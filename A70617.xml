         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing once in conference with Mr. <hi>Robert Garner,</hi> that ſhould have been about the lawfulneſſe or unlawfulneſſe of Baptizing Infants, I deſired the foundation of all might be firſt diſcourſed, concerning Jeſus Chriſt, whether hee were the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, or no; which took up our time, without agreement, then I yeelded him to wave that; And if he would either ſet downe: <hi>1.</hi> What the Ordinance (not the forme or materials, but this ordinance) of Baptiſme is, <hi>2.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what grounds to be adminiſtred. <hi>3.</hi> To what end, and then ſet downe his poſition of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe of baptiſing the infants of the Church: And I would anſwer him, or if he required, I would anſwer the three queſtions, and ſet down my poſition of the lawfulneſſe of baptiſing the infants of the Church, or profest Christians. But more of him in this I heard not, till I met with his book, in which he hath fallen on the foundation, endevouring to darken it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute with his pen, what he could not with his tongue, and therein hath been pleaſed to joyne two brethren of his own judgement and practiſe about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme with me, thinking his friends will take it, that he anſwers one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the other, and ſo confutes both, when he confutes neither; the men I reverence and love, and eſteeme gracious, and in many things before my ſelfe; but I ſuppoſe, if they did believe and hold the foundation in reſpect of the extent of it, as I doe, they would not count unlawfull the baptiſing of ſuch infants, as by gracious providence are brought into the charge &amp; tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians, to bring up for Chriſt, as I hope all Chriſtians take their little ones to be: But far be it from me to judge my Brethren, that doe, or leave undone to the Lord, and for the Lord, in maner of uſing an ordinance; what have I to do to judge the ſervants of my Lord and Maſter, to his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth, but anſwer I may when they call me to it, only for the truth of the Goſpel, and the plain ſayings of Chriſt, and againſt that which oppoſeth the ſame, and ſo cals Chriſt execrable (in opinion or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe) do I contend, and ſo far ſhould I contend againſt the denying bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing infants, or renouncing that Baptiſme then received, to take another, and ſtill love thoſe I contend with, yea, as brethren, ſo farre as they exalt Chriſt: But the oppoſition of the truth of Chriſts own words in the Goſpell, and the faith thereof, I cannot look at as done to the Lord in any better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then <hi>Saul,</hi> thought in his conſcience, he was bound to do many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Name of Chriſt. Therfore, meeting with a book of Mr. <hi>Garners,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47546:3"/>with a glorious title oppoſing all the way the truth of the ſayings of Chriſt. I have been, (notwithſtanding my love and reverence of the man and his parts) the more plain, and rough in diſcovering, or uncovering thoſe <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Deceits;</hi> covered over with acknowledgement of ſome parts of truth, and pretence of unvailing Myſteries: which I had no ſooner done, but there was ſent me from <hi>London</hi> a Book of one Mr. <hi>Tho. Whitfeilds,</hi> ſome yeares ſince a Miniſter in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> and a Lecturer, as they ſay alſo, at <hi>Stamford,</hi> and ſince, as himſelfe ſaith, at <hi>Yarmouth:</hi> and now I ſuppoſe, againe in <hi>Northampton ſhire,</hi> nigh <hi>Rutland,</hi> who pretended an examination of my Booke: which either he did very ſleightly, or anſwered very unfaithfully, and miſtaking or flying my ſayings; framed other, ſuppoſing to anſwer me, in Anſwering <hi>Arminius;</hi> To whom for all that concerneth my Book, my Anſwers to Mr. <hi>Garner,</hi> do fully anſwer; yet I have afforded a ſmall reply to him, that he may not thinke himſelf ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor adored; only I am ſorry for the ſake of Miniſters profeſt Divines, that ſo grave a one ſhould publiſh <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> with ſuch weake and unſavoury confutations; after ſuch ſound and learned ones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A rich ſtore, not leſſe then a redemption, reconciliation, and ſalvation of our nature in the Sonne of God, and for men, even the worſt of men, not yet called, and to be after called: And is it in any, before by the heavenly call they be prevailed with, to come in, and eat thereof; and then is not the proviſion larger then the receit: And doth not Wiſdome (the proviſion being made) both ſend her maydens and by ſpirit go her ſelfe in, and with them, and call even the worſt of men (as by comparing this with <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. appeares) and that not equivocally, but in earneſt to turne, and come, and eat, and ſurely of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what Wiſdome had really prepared for them: Yea, though ſome refuſe to turne, and come, and are therefore put by, and eat not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, &amp;c. Can you reade this Scripture, and not acknowledge the truth of the diſtinction, and that the former is larger then the latter?</p>
               <p>But to proceed: <hi>Matth.</hi> 22 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven is like unto a certaine King, which made a marriage for his ſonne, and ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come: Againe, he ſent forth other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden: Behold, I have prepared my Dinner, my oxen, and my fatlings are killed, and all things are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47546:5"/>ready; come unto the marriage; but they all made light of it,</hi> &amp;c. Is not there the ſame with that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. A rich proviſion, is it not larger then the receit, and ſet forth and affirmed ready for ſuch, as yet had it not, and are they not on that ground called and envited; yet they come not then nor after, for even for their refuſall, they were ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Now I hope Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> will not ſay the ſecond time; There was nothing prepared, and ready for them, that in comming they might have had, and eaten: And is not the truth of the diſtinction here appearing.</p>
               <p>And that the former part is larger then the latter in receit.</p>
               <p>But I proceed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9. <hi>And being made perfect, hee became</hi> (or was made) <hi>the Author of eternall ſalvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Mind this well, Is it not here affirmed of Chriſt? 1. That hee was made perfect. 2. That being made perfect, hee was made the Author of eternall ſalvation: And 3. That hee is the Author of eternall ſalvation unto all them that obey him. Conſider all theſe three as the Scripture ſets them before us: And ſo;</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt: Was he ever at any time unperfect; ſurely in himſelfe in his owne perſon: This Son of God, that is, the Chriſt, he was perfect from all eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed him in the beginning of his way, before his workes of old.</hi> 23. <hi>He was ſet up from ever laſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was,</hi> &amp;c. 26. <hi>Before the hils, was he brought forth</hi> &amp;c. when he gave the decrees, he was by him as one brought up, and was daily his delight, rejoycing ever before him, <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 1.15. <hi>The Image of the inviſible God, the firſt borne of every creature, Philip.</hi> 2 6. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, Joh.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Glorified with his Fathers owne ſelfe, before the world was:</hi> So that in, and for himſelfe, he was perfect, in higheſt degree of perfection; and ſo might himſelfe without any of us have abode in that glory. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.24. But in this his glory, and glorious perfection abiding, and not laying it aſide, and becomming lower, he could not be for mankind, that was fallen into ſinne, and under death; a perfect JESUS, a perfect Propitiation, peace, righteouſneſſe, and perfect Lord, Saviour,
<pb facs="tcp:47546:5"/>and helper of mankinde, which he muſt certainly bee, or elſe he cannot be the author of eternall ſalvation; That he might be perfect then in regard of us; it was neceſſary that he be made fleſh in our very nature, that ſo the nature that ſinneth might ſuffer: <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. yea, in our nature as fallen, and ſo ſubmitted to infirmities, and mortallity, even to the fleſh and blood, that he might dye <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. And that hee be in this our nature ſubjected to infirmities, as a publike ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he muſt own this charge, and imputation, and confeſſe alſo, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.5 9. <hi>Pſal</hi> 40 7.12. And that our ſinnes being charged on him, and he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the charge; he alſo undergoe the ſentence, and ſo dyed for our ſinnes; <hi>for without ſhedding of blood, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.24. <hi>and</hi> 3 18. <hi>Heb</hi> 9 22. And yet that he may be perfect for us; it is neceſſary that he riſe from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit of all our ſinne and a victory over our death, <hi>that as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and truth are met, and righteouſneſſe and peace doe kiſſe,</hi> in his Death, <hi>So truth may ſpring out of the earth,</hi> in his reſurrection for our juſtification <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10, 11. <hi>Rom</hi> 4 25. <hi>For if Chriſt be not raiſed, our faith is vain, we are yet in our ſinnes</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. And now he is ſo riſen, yet there is ſtill more to be done by him, neceſſary that he might be a perfect Saviour, namely That by the eternall ſpirit, he aſcend into the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even the <hi>holy of holieſt,</hi> and there appeare before God for us and preſent at the propitiatory, or mercy ſeat, and boſome, of the Father, the vertue of his blood ſhed: He being now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and ſo offer to him, his own riſen, and holy body; <hi>a ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſacrifice, a price, a ranſome</hi> for thoſe for whom he dyed; that ſo thereby, he may obtain, and procure of his Father.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A right of Lordſhip over us all. 1. That wee may be his by purchaſe, and he have the power and authority over us,

But he having gon through; and done all firſt mentioned, and now obtained all this latter mentioned; he is made perfect, and become perfect, and ſo as it is ſaid of him, <hi>Luke,</hi> 24.26, 46. ought not <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory; thus it is writen, and thus it behooved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day and that repentance, and remiſſion of ſinns ſhould be preached in his name among all nations, ſo it is ſaid even of God the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, <hi>It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſonns unto glory, to make the Captaine of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings;</hi> ſuitable to which it is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, Heb, 5.8. <hi>Though he was a ſonne, yet learned he Obedience by the things, which he ſuffered</hi> (as I underſtand) he tooke occaſion to ſhew forth obedience by the things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he ſuffered, and ſo was made perfect, yea perfect in the higheſt degree of perfection, though not while he was ſuffering yet by, and through, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47546:6"/>not in one thing only ſuffered; but the things which hee ſuffered, his ſufferings: for had he not had our nature ſubjected to humane infirmities; and that made under the law for us, he could not have dyed for us, and then truth, and mercy could not have mett; righteouſneſſe and peace could not have kiſſed on our behalfe <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.

                  <hi>He is the author of eternall ſalvation, to all them that obey him.</hi> But I beleeve that it is not in Scripture ſaid, nor that Mr. <hi>Gerner,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Knowles,</hi> either can ſhew it there: That he is ſaid to be the author of eternall ſalvation to the world, or the whole world, as he is ſaid to be the Saviour of the world, <hi>and the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world:</hi> nor is he ſaid to be the author of eternall ſalvation to all men, as he is ſaid to <hi>dye for all, and to have given himſelfe a ranſome for all:</hi> nor is he ſaid to be the author of eternall ſalvation to the unjuſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his enemies; as he is ſaid to have dy'd for them: and til they can ſhew this, they cannot diſparage the diſtinction, for we may ſee it all the way through the Goſpell ſaying, as in this <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9 <hi>He is the author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him;</hi> according to that is ſaid of the wil of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; namely;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That of all the Father hath given him</hi> to undertake for, and upon the offering of his ſacrifice; he hath given him, into his diſpoſe to order and judge <hi>Pal.</hi> 2.7 9, 10 <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9, 11, 12. He ſhould ſave them with ſuch a ſalvation as may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the knowledge of the truth, and then, bring them to the knowledge of the truth, and looſe none of them, <hi>but raiſe them up at the laſt day</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 4. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. and this will be manifeſt one day, that he hath done it, when all ſhall by him, be raiſed, and come before him, and acknowledge him Lord, to the glory of God; when it will be manifeſt, that who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of them be loſt, and periſh, he did not looſe them; but they loſt themſelves, and brought diſtruction on themſelves: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 21, 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Mat,</hi> 16.26. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. But now for, eternall life, it is not ſo ſaid, of all ſo given, but of a giving upon, or after a giving: namely, after all by vertue of his ſacrifice, are given in to his diſpoſe, then thoſe that by diſcoveries of grace, are in the heavenly call gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, in being brought to, and united in him, in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him, <hi>That he may give them eternall life, Iohn.</hi> 17.2. and ſo he ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.40. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeveth on him, may have everlaſting life, and</hi> I <hi>will raiſe him up at the laſt day:</hi> Like to this alſo was;</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47546:9"/>2. The end of the miſſion, or ſending him into the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſhould doe that for men, and uſe ſuch meanes to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards them, <hi>that the world through him might be ſaved:</hi> But more, <hi>that whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh</hi> (as there may be a ſaving, and yet an after periſhing of ſome, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5.) but that they that beleeve ſhall have everlaſting life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16, 17, 36.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Like to this alſo is the end of the power, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſpirit, that the Father hath given to Chriſt his Sonne, and our Saviour, namely; That he may rule over all fleſh, and be their right and lawfull Lord, and ſo preach good tidings to them, and ſhew mercy to them, <hi>to comfort all that mourne Iohn</hi> 17.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 61.1, 2. and to raiſe them from the dead, and judge them according to their obedience, or diſobedience to him: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.27, 28, 29. But to give eternall life to as many as by the heavenly call, are brought in to ſee him, and beleeve on him, and ſo given him: <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.2. with 6.4. The mourners in Syon, to whom he is to give beuty for aſhes: <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.3.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Like to this alſo is the proclamation, and doctrine of the Goſpell, declaring peace, pardon, and mercy in Chriſt, for all, and tendering it to all, where it comes, whether they accept, or refuſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.5. with promiſe or acceptance, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32, 38 39. But the promiſe of receit of forgiveneſſe and eternall life, is ever, and only to thoſe that beleeve on him, and harken to him: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3 15, 36. <hi>Iſay,</hi> 55.3, 4 ſo that all the way through the doctrine of the Goſpell, the diſtinction between a ſalvation in Chriſt, tendered to men, and the ſame given into, and working in men, is cleare; the former generally for all men, to be tendered to them; and and the other only to thoſe that obey him.</p>
               <p>But it would fill many leaves, to explain and ſet forth that which the Scripture ſetteth forth, evidencing this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction: as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.3, 13, ſetting forth a purgation, by ofire prepared, and the Pot with liquour, and choiſe peeces of fleſh put in, which is a good preparation for purging, and bringing forth the Scum; and then of the efficafie of the fire; bringing the ſcum a loft; in which reſpect, the liquor is ſaid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47546:10"/>to be purged; and then of the obſtenacy of the people, in not ſuffering the ſcum when raiſed to be taken off, and thrown out, and ſo it boyled in again, and the liquor was not purged; and therefore the following purgation was to be conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and burning of pot, and liquor and fleſh and bones, and ſcum, and all together: Doth not this ſhadow out to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation, and atonment, or propitiation wrought by Chriſt in himſelfe, that is full of force, and vertue (as fire) for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, like that is ſaid of him <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. And the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this grace or purging, and peace, to reprove for folly, and to call into Chriſt, and ſo in convincement to make the ſcum to ariſe, like that <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Prov,</hi> 1.22, 23 and then the rebellion of many, for whom this purgation was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to whom being tendered, it begun to worke, and raiſe the ſcum, in which reſpect they are ſaid to be purged: like that <hi>Eſay,</hi> 5.1, 8. <hi>But they loving darkneſſe rather then light, offering deſpite to the ſpirit of grace,</hi> and in that reſpect not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and for that cauſe to be deſtroyed: like that <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. Though ſuch as receive the purgation, and yeild to the opperation of it are purged indeed, like that <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. and is not here a diſtinction, between a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, prepared and tendered and opperating, and the ſame purgation, received, ſubmitted too, and ſo enjoyed, in the choiſe effecaſie, and fruit thereof, and the former larger then the latter, how ſaith the text, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>in thy filthyneſſe is lewdneſſe; Becauſe</hi> I <hi>have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged; thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthyneſſe any more, till</hi> I <hi>have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee:</hi> now as they were tipes and figures to us, doth it not ſhew all aforeſaid?</p>
               <p>Beſides, to what purpoſe is the Councell to ſuch as are poore, blind, naked, &amp;c. to come to Chriſt, <hi>to buy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him <hi>Gold tryed, white raiment, and eye-ſalve to anoint &amp;c.</hi> if the proviſion of theſe prepared in Chriſt, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, be no larger then the receipt and enjoyment by men, ſure thoſe that have received, and doe enjoy, theſe are not poore, blind, naked, and miſerable; and they that are Deſtitute of theſe, and ſo poore, blind, naked and miſerable, are in vain counſelled to goe to get theſe things of Chriſt;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47546:10"/>if there be not proviſion and fulneſſe in him, for any but thoſe that have it in them all ready: but ſee, Chriſt gave no vain councell, and yet he gave this councell <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 18. yet if we ſhould take notice of ſome parables uttered, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Saviour, will it not hold forth the ſame diſtinction to us evidently: conſider;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat</hi> 13.39. 18.23, 24, 28.37.43. Is not the field there the world of mankind, ſuch men as are neither borne of God, nor given up to the Devill, before either good ſeed, or tares be ſowen, Is it not Chriſt his own field, and that alſo as he is the Sonne of man, (and is not that by vertue of his death, reſurrection, and ranſome, wherewith he purchaſed them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2.6, 9. <hi>and</hi> 24.1, 2.) Is not Chriſt and the word diſcovering him, the ſeed, and good ſeed, before it be ſown? And are not thoſe that have received that good ſeed, and are borne thereof (as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.23.) and ſo the blade ſpring up of the ſame ſeed (as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19, 19.) The children of the Kingdome: and the tares ſprung up from the evill ſeed: the children of the Devill: And are not all ſtill in one field, which is the world of mankind? which in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this mingle-mangle, of one, and another, (not the Church and Kingdome ſure, but the world of mankind, as now) ends at the comming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now is not the field of mankind (that is not the Devils, who ſoweth in another mans field but Chriſts the Sonne of mans field) larger then the Children of the Kingdome, yea, is there not more ſeed ſown, then is rightly received; and brings forth fruit to the harveſt: I ſay no more, but read the parrables with there interpretations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>and Luke</hi> 8.5, 13. Thus far the diſtinction appeares, approved in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by ſayings that are more remote in regard of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, But if wee come to view thoſe that are neerer, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it will more brighter and fully appeare: as if I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the language of the Scripture, and ſpirit of wiſdome therein ſpeaking. That when it ſpeaketh of the death of Chriſt, for propitiation, and ſo of his ranſome, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and peace compleated in his owne body for men. And the common ſalvation extended there-through
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47546:11"/>to men, as apropitiation, and ground of calling men: It ſpeaks of it in generall words, as for all, for the world for ſinners: But if in the ſame place, it ſpeakes of the peculiar priviledges enjoyed; it changeth the perſon, and ſpeakes more limmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, and applicatively; which would not alwaies be, if both were of like large extent, as is ſhewne in the treatiſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 10, <hi>page</hi> 53.54. and may be more fully, when need is; But that which is all ready ſhewn in the Treatiſe is enough, where the diſtinction is ſhown, and proved to be in the Scripture, where firſt the ſeverall parts of the diſtinction are proved: The firſt part proved in divers plain ſentences of Scripture, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>page</hi> 2. (which Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> miſ-repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Treatiſe, <hi>page</hi> 6. as alledged for the proofe of the whole diſtinction) and in the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>page</hi> 3.4. The firſt part is explecated, the ſecond part of the diſtinction is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved alſo by divers ſentences of Scripture: <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 5.6, and explicated alſo <hi>pag.</hi> 6 7. Again ſecondly the diſtinctionit ſelfe is proved in expreſſe words, in plain ſentences of Scripture <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>page.</hi> 24. which Scriptures Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> receiting in his Treatiſe <hi>page</hi> 12.11. leaves out ſome verſes, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction might be hid from his owne, and other mens eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The diſtinction is explicated and proved by Scripture in eight particulars, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>page</hi> 14, <hi>and</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, the whole five firſt chapters in that Treatiſe do evidence the ſame to be in Scripture plentifully ſhewne, all which it became Mr. <hi>Gerner</hi> to have refuſed by plain ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scriptue, before he had ſo boldly, againſt ſuch a appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring truth affirmed; That the Scripture warrenteth no ſuch diſtinction: But I will now veiw his reaſons, or proofes which he oppoſeth with all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He charheth me to propound theſe things rather in way of ſeparation, then diſtinction. and gives this as his ground; Becauſe I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt hath wroth ſalvation, or redemption in himſelfe, in the nature of, and for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with God, but that he hath not wrought ſalvation or redemption in all men to God which phraſe, and termes of mine, are by him ſubtilly altered, to all perſons before God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47546:11"/>and for all perſons in themſelves) and thus (he ſaith) I devide Chriſt and his redemption; Surely it is no great matter for me to be ſlandered by him, that hath firſt ſlandered the Scripture, nor need I to anſwer him in this matter, wherein every judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader that readeth that Treatiſe, may ſee he writes falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>I beleeve there are three that beare record in Heaven, the Father, the word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7. A diſtinction, yet no ſeparation or diviſion. I beleeve the Father is one, the Sonne another, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.31.32.37. and 7.16.17.18. The Holy Ghoſt another, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16.17. Diſtinct not devided, the three one ſtill: I beleive that the Father is God, and yet that he ſent the Sonne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. and ſo that the Sonne is God, and yet he was ſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.2. and that the Holy Ghoſt is God, and yet that he proceedeth from the Father, and the Sonne. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.26. and 15.26. Yet no ſeparation, I beleeve ſtill there is but one God, and that the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt are one and the ſame God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. Yea, further, I beleeve that this Sonne of God was really in being before hee tooke fleſh. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.22.31. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1, 2, 3.10.11. And that in fulneſſe of time he was made fleſh, and walked up and downe among men in a fraile and mortall body, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14. And as he was on Earth, the Father was greater then he <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.28. yet here is no ſeparation, not two Sons, but one and the ſame ſon ſtill, and the father and he are one, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.29, 30. I beleeve that this ſon of God in the nature of mankind, the man Chriſt, did in that nature dye for our ſins, and in the ſame nature riſe for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. And that in the ſame nature, he did by the eternall Spirit aſcend to Heaven, and offer himſelfe a Sacrifice and ranſome for mankind to God. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. So that the nature of mankind is fully reſtored, raiſed, and glorified in this publique man, whom God hath accepted and glorified with his owne ſelfe, and filled him with all fullneſſe of grace, and truth, and given over all into his diſpoſe, ſo as full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of redemption, Propitiation, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and life is in him, and that for men. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.4.14.16, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. 1 Pet. 3.20. and can never be ſeparate, or devided from him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47546:12"/>he, and it, are ever one, and together. Neither can this propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation be otherwiſe enjoyed by any, but by comming in to him; receiving him, ſo as to ahve him, and be one in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. Yet I alſo believe, that all that know not Chriſt, that receive him not, that believe him not, but lye in unbeliefe, that they are out of the way of peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10.19. Dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, under the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and of the wicked one, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 21, 23. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. And ſo know not Chriſt, nor are known, or owned of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. And ſo are not his people not beloved in that love wherewith God loveth his Sonne; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 25 26. And ſo whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, or life be in Chriſt for them; yet they have none of it in themſelves: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6 53. Yet when any of them are by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, in the appearance of the grace of God in Chriſt brought out of the power of Satan, and darkneſſe to beleeve in Chriſt, ſo as they receive him, and are therein united to him; They are then, and therein of the ſame ſeed, and heires, and he gives to them the priviledges of ſonnes, and they have the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life that is in Chriſt, which before they had not, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12, 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. And others yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine without.</p>
               <p>Now in all this, there is not the leaſt dividing of Chriſt and his redemption, which is ever in him, and wrought by him; ſo that in this ſaying, Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> hath done nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Diſtinction, but to give us juſt cauſe of griefe, that ſuch men as Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knoles</hi> ſhould be no better inſighted in Divinity, and about redemption in and by Chriſt; Then that the one ſhould affirme, and the other approve it, that ſuch a Diſtinctionis a ſeparating, and dividing Chriſt and his redemption.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee how he helpes it after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. <q>That in ſearching the Scripture, wee ſhall find that where mention is made of Redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concliiation, and ſalvation, as concerning perſons redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wee are to underſtand it to be ſpoken of thoſe who are reconciled unto God, or made partakers of redemption, reconciliation, juſtification, and ſalvation in themſelves
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47546:12"/>before God by Jeſus Chriſt: So we are to underſtand theſe Scriptures following, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: It's not faire dealing for a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt, for perſons, to put in perſons reconciled: But to paſſe his often altering of phraſes for advantage ſake, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hisſaying according as it is uſed in Scripture, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in our language.</p>
               <p>He apeareth in this Treatiſe as a Sholler, with his <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> page, 40. to 41. Though <hi>T.

               <p n="2">2. That there is a redemption, purchaſe, or recovery, of that which one hath himſelf fore bought, or purchaſed; but the thing purchaſed, is wrongfully by force or fraud, taken or detar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the right Lord &amp; owner, and ſo he ranſomes, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, or recovereth it again, out of the hand of unjuſt detainers of it; and this moſt properly called redemption (though not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor and alwaies) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.18, 19. <hi>&amp;c.

He ſecretly, and covertly faults the diſtinction about the ſeverall endes of the death of Chriſt, one for propitiation, and one for witneſſe bearing to the truth, and ſo giving us exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of obedience to God, and love to one another; and one for confirming the new Teſtament, all which are proved, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in the ſecond <hi>chapter page</hi> 16, 21. and not at all by him refuſed; and if he deſire any further explanation, or proofe, he might have it; I trow he will not ſay, <hi>that as Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes,</hi> the Scribes and Phariſes did make him fleſh, or under the Law for us; or that they did charge our ſinnes upon him; or put him to death for them; but that God the Father did all this to Chriſt for us, <hi>and ſo delivered him for our offences, and raiſed him for our juſtification: Iſay.</hi> 53.6. <hi>Rom</hi> 4 24, 25.</p>
               <p>I hope alſo he will not ſay, that as Chriſt did <hi>willingly lay down his life</hi> in ſuffering, all that befell him, or witneſſe-bearing to the truth, for calling ſheep, and feeding the called, and to give us an example to follow his ſteps therein; that God did perſecute, and crucifie him for ſpeaking the words he gave him to ſpeake, and doing of that he gave him to doe for the good of men, and the ſpeciall good of his ſheep; But that the Scribes and Phariſes, the Elders chiefe Prieſts &amp;c. did through envy perſecute, crucifie and put him to death for that: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.18. I hope he that can ſee the difference between Gods ſending <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi> for good; and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ſending him for evill; can ſee the difference in this alſo; and ſo diſtinguiſh of the ends of the ſame death of Chriſt, in theſe reſpects.</p>
               <p>And for the third end, is that a confirmation of a Teſtament when the Teſtator is put to death, as an evill doer; ſurely its not proper to ſay, God the Father put him to death, to confirme Chriſt his owne Teſtament; nor did the Phariſees ſo put him to death, but as he was one with the Father in will, and ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeelded himſelfe to dye for our ſinnes, and willingly laid down his life in witneſſe-bearing too, and defence of the truth he had preached, ſo he moſt willingly and freely (as his owne more peculiar acting) did give up the ghoſt and die to ratifie the new Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. <hi>Galath.</hi> 3.14, 15. which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

And ſo freely dyed, and confirmed his Teſtament: But Maſter <hi>Garner</hi> would be faulting, knew he how, ſaying, that I ſpeaking of the ſeverall ends of his death in my Treatiſe, pag. 22.

That I ſay, That when the death of Chriſt in reſpect of that end which was for propitiation, and ranſome is only mentioned, as it is for all, ſo it is expreſt in ſuch generall words only,</q> as the world, all men, &amp;c. (But here he hath clipt my words, and left out that I ſay in Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for faith, it is here expreſt) and for this I quote hee ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hee ſhould have done well to have put in many other places, and expreſſions quoted, Chap. 20. pag. 133.

But this concluſion is unſound ſaith he, which will appeare from what is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. where mention is made, ſaith he, of the death of Chriſt, in reſpect of ranſome and propitiation only, &amp;c. And yet it is not expreſt in ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall words, as the world, or all men, to which I anſwer hee hath corruptly left out &amp;c. which was explained in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, chap. 20. pag. 33. But to paſſe that, I queſtion his firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and deny his ſecond, though he calls, to mind it, and double the ſame. But now let us mind it well, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. So Chriſt was once offered, &amp;c. Is the words or ſenſe here only, that he once dyed. True it is that the offering to dye, is, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be called an offering, but is rarely found, that the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt to God includes but his death only, however it is manifeſt in this chapter, that here it ſignifies more then death; yea, are ſimply a ranſome, or price to purchaſe of God only,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47546:19"/>even a ſacrifice, that is both a ranſome, or price to purchaſe, and a reconciliation, atonement, or peace made with God for men; and ſuch a taking away the ſinnes of the world from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and men, that mercy may be ſhewne them, and meanes uſed towards them, yea, and yet farther, that this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his; might be a remaining and continual thing before the Father, that Chriſt by vertue thereof, might mediate in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for men, and ſo ſend forth ſpirit in the meanes, that they might be convinced, <hi>repent and beleeve,</hi> and in ſpeciall <hi>by amedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new Teſtament,</hi> for beleevers; that he by vertue of this his Sacrifice may purge them, and they receive the promiſe of the eternall inheritance: and all this is manifeſt in this whole chapter, and the drift and buſineſſe the Apoſtle was about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend it dilligently: He is here treating <hi>chapter</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 8. and this 9. about the High prieſt-hood of Jeſus Chriſt; and eſpecially mentions Chriſt his comming, <hi>verſe</hi> 11.

               <p>Hee did not offer himſelfe ſuch a ſacrifice on the wooden Croſſe, that was not the Altar by, and on which Chriſt was born and offered (through the fooliſh Idolatrous Romaniſts have ſo eſteemed and ſo prayed, Oh holy Altar of the Croſſe ſave us) our Saviour himſelfe calls ſuch conceivers fooles, and teacheth us, that the Altar both ſanctifieth the gift, and is greater then the gift <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.19. which <hi>I</hi> hope none will ſay of the wooden Croſſe, that it ſanctifieth the body of Chriſt, and is greater then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt: but the divine nature was greater then the humane,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47546:19"/>and did ſanctifie and dignifie the gift, the humane nature or body of Chriſt, and by this divine nature, even the eternall ſpirit which ſupported him in his ſufferings, and by which he roſe from the dead. By that ſpirit he was born up, and offered himſelf a ſacrifice to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</p>
               <p>He went to the croſſe a ſinner for us, he bore our ſins to the tree, and was made ſinne and a curſe for us, and dyed for our ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. but he was raiſed for our juſtification, and being riſen juſt and holy, he then offered himſelfe (not ſpotted with our ſinnes on him, but) a ſpotleſſe Sacrifice (without fault or ſpot) to God. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14.</p>
               <p>This ſacrifice was not offered here on earth, the other high Prieſts did offer on earth, they could but heare and lift up and wave before the Lord the offering, and approach into a worldly Sanctuary, But Jeſus Chriſt appeared in the higheſt Heaven, and there preſented the vertue of his blood, and offered his ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1.3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>This Sacrince of Chriſt was offered in the Heaven, not to men or Angels, but unto God, In this buſineſſe or Sacrifice offering, he had not to deale with men, though for men with God.

But let us fullfill his requeſt, and proceed to mind it a little further, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. So Chriſt was once offered to beare the ſins of, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is not certain, that in this place, the word beare the ſinnes, doth ſignifie, to be counted the ſinner, and ſo to accept the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, and beare the puniſhment due unto them, of which is meant, <hi>Iſay</hi> 53.2.3, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21. For ſo and in that ſence he his owne ſelfe in his owne body bear our ſins to the tree, or on the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and ſo in that reſpect he is ſaid to have been made a curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. And this was before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furection for our juſtification, and ſo the offering, or complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the offering mentioned in this chap. which offering is ſaid
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47546:20"/>to be to beare the ſinnes of, &amp;c. In which offering he is not ſaid to be made a curſe, as he was, when he hung upon the tree, but a bleſſing. A great high Prieſt of good things to come, of which high Prieſthood, he treateth, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. and 8. and this 9. <hi>chap.</hi> and that we may the better underſtand what bearing is here meant, let us looke into the words, and <hi>chap.</hi> conſider the tipes here mentioned, and the truth as it is found in Jeſus.</p>

Note further, that in the tipes were two Goates, one that was ſlaine for a ſin offering, and the blood preſented in the holy place, and ſprinkled on the mercy ſeat to make an attonement. The truth of what is ſhadowed therein, is found in Chriſt that beare our ſinnes in his body to the tree, and dyed for them, and being riſen hath preſented the vertue of his blood in the holyes of holyes, and ſo obtained eternall redemption, and made an aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for men, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. and 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12, 13. 14. But we ſo ſin againſt this goodneſſe, that we give God juſt cauſe to hold back all the ſtreames of mercy from us, by which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And is not the truth of this found in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, that is riſen for our juſtification and now at the right hand of Godalive for evermore, by vertue of his Sacrifice, mediating for men with God his father; ſo removing and taking away from before his face, that ignorance, unbeleife and rebellion of men, that might juſtly procure the with holding all ſtreames of mercy from them, and the preſent giving them up to a reprobate ſcence, and to Satan, and ſo deſtroying them with his ſoreſt judgements, that ſtill through Chriſt they are preſerved alive, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, mercies, meanes, and ſome light and motions of ſpirit are extended to lead them to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10.22. <hi>and</hi> 2.4, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. And to thoſe that through his grace,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47546:20"/>are brought in by repentance, and faith to Chriſt, to take of their following evills, to cleanſe and purifie them to conformity with himſelfe, and to bring them to his inheritance, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.15. but to proceed a little further, and conſider ſomething in this buſineſſe, ſhadowed or typed in the Iewiſh high Prieſt (and in a ſort Prieſts and Levites alſo) who was to beare the names, and alſo the judgement of the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> upon his heart, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29, 30. To beare the iniquity of the Congregation, to make an attonement for them before the Lord, Yea, the offerings fore offered, were given them to eate before the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.17. Yea, to beare the iniquity of the Sanctuary, and to keep the charge of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.1.4. And to doe the ſervice of the Tabernacle, and ſo not the Children of <hi>Jſrael,</hi> But they to beare the iniquity of the Children of <hi>Jſrael, Numb.</hi> 18.22, 23. Now what bearing this was is to be conſidered. Was it that the high Prieſt, and Prieſts ſhould have the ſinnes of the people imputed to them; and that they ſhould be counted ſinners for or in ſtead of the people, and ſuffer the puniſhment the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould have ſuffered, that ſo the people might have an eſcape. I beleeve no ſuch matter, and yet it was thus with Jeſus Chriſt; when he was made fleſh for us: But ſure there is another under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their bearing the peoples iniquity, and judgement, and yet nothing is therein ſhadowed, but what in the truth of it is found in Jeſus Chriſt our great high Prieſt alſo, if tranſlators of as great skill in the Hebrew, as Mr <hi>Garner</hi> in the Greeke, may be truſted, they ſay, the word <hi>to beare, Lev.</hi> 10.17. is to beare or take away; and that the Greek tranſlateth it that yee ſhould take away, but whether they be credited or not, doe not the word themſelves give forth ſuch a ſenſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 18.22.23. Neither muſt the children of <hi>Iſrael henceforth come nigh the Tabernacle of the congregation, leſt they beare ſinne, and dye, but the Levits ſhall doe the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the congregation, and they ſhall beare their inquity: It ſhall be a ſtaiute for ever:</hi> Now I pray what bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of iniquity was this, but a taking away of their iniquity, by miniſtring about, and ordering the holy things, burning incenſe offering the Sacrifices. &amp;c. (which the people were not betru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to doe) that they might have Gods Ordinances, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47546:21"/>therein, and mercies, &amp;c. continued to them? And how ſhould the high Prieſt upon his heart beare the judgement of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Lord continually <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.30. but in tender compaſſion and love to them, and care for them ſo to miniſter in their behalfe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now is not the truth of all this found in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great high Prieſt, is not he the miniſter of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, or holy things, <hi>and of the true Tabernacle &amp;c.

Is not all that is born of the fleſh, fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp; ſhall not all fleſh wither? Iſay.</hi> 40.7.8. And is not Jeſus Chriſt our high Prieſt, full of love, compaſſion, and faithfulneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. <hi>and</hi> 4.15. <hi>and</hi> 5.25. and is not he the <hi>Mediator between God and man</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5., and the advocate of beleevers 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>and is he not able to ſave them to the utmoſt that come to God by him</hi> (or as in this <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. that looke, waite for, or expect him) ſeeing he ever liveth <hi>to make interceſſion for them:</hi> Now the Apoſtle treating of the high Prieſt-hood of Chriſt, and mentioning types in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhewing the truth of all to be in Chriſt, where ſhall we find the truth of theſe things typed that have been mentioned about the Scape-Goat, &amp; the Prieſt bearing or taking away the ſinnes, and judgements of the people in thoſe reſpects fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if not in the 26, &amp; this 28. verſes; and ſo I charge not M. <hi>Garners</hi> ſenſe here with falſehood, but imperfection, I fault him, not for ſaying, the death of Chriſt, and his offering, as it is for propitiation and ranſome is heerment, but for his putting in only, and ſo limmiting it to that only; where as it appeares plainly by the whole chapter, here is more ment.</p>
               <p>But now I will veiw his ſecond affirmation; <hi>It is not in ſuch generall words, as the world, all men, &amp;c.</hi> for which veiw the words againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>So Chriſt was once offered, to beare the ſinnes of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he appeare the ſecond time without ſinne unto ſalvation;</hi> mind it ſaith he, and ſo I pray let us; it is not ſaid he, was once offered to beare the ſinnes of many, and he ſhall appear the ſecond time to them, or to thoſe many, without ſinne unto ſalvation; <hi>But unto them that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47546:21"/>looke and waite for him,</hi> as a ſpeciall culled out of the generall, and is not <hi>many,</hi> here then as generall a word as the world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or all men: Let us a little mind the word <hi>many,</hi> as it is here uſed and ſee;</p>
               <p>Enough is ſhewed in the oppoſed Treatiſe, <hi>chapter</hi> 3. <hi>page</hi> 22. <hi>chapter</hi> 8. <hi>page</hi> 48. and <hi>chapter</hi> 14. <hi>page</hi> 76 if compared together, that is not at all anſwered by him: And though the word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in divers places have a twofold ſenſe, one larger, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſpeciall; and in ſuch places, I did not parralell it with ſuch generall words, as <hi>all men,</hi> &amp; <hi>every man,</hi> when ſpoken in the largeſt ſenſe, yet in ſome ſort and reſpect I did and do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. <hi>through the offence of one, many be dead:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>By one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners:</hi> And is not many here all and every man that had being by propogation from <hi>Adam, Pſal.</hi> 29.3. <hi>The voice of the Lord upon many waters</hi> (are not the waters <hi>peoples, multitudes, Nations, and tongues Rev.</hi> 17,15.) now doth not his Kingdome rule over all <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.19. <hi>and</hi> 66 7. <hi>and</hi> 119.89.91, and is not many here as generall a word, as the world, or all men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Micah</hi> 4.3. <hi>He ſhall judge among many people,</hi> ſurely whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in the firſt fruits, when this is compleatly fulfilled: It will as large as that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is not this as large, and generall, as all men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, <hi>ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt,</hi> ſurely what ever firſt fruites of this may be in the call of the Jewes; and though here be a word not uſuall in ſuch a buſineſſe, as many of them; for which alſo a reaſon might be given; yet by our Saviours ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.42, 43. It appeares it will be as large, as that <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. ſo that if plentifully appeareth, the word many, is often as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as the word <hi>all men:</hi> But that I may do M. <hi>Garner</hi> no wrong I will a little further conſider the word many, becauſe it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly uſed, and ſo let us conſider it;</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is ſometimes uſed, with a ſpeciall limmitting, and reſtraining word, ſingling out from others, and pointing to ſome ſpeciall, and this ſometime to the better part as <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, oppoſite</hi> to the reſidue that did not, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47546:22"/>So <hi>Revel,</hi> 3.19. <hi>and</hi> 13.15. yet here it ſignifieth all of that ſort: and</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some times to the worſer part, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the word <hi>many</hi> is ſome times uſed without any ſuch word, and then it is alwaies generall and larger, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the twofold buſineſſe mentioned, carries too a twofold ſenſe, one generall, and the other more ſpeciall, as is ſhewn in the oppoſed Treatiſe, and ſome times one buſineſſe mentioned, and then it is as generall, as <hi>all men,</hi> as in the place quoted.</p>
               <p>But the word <hi>many,</hi> uſed without a ſpeciall limmitting word, is never uſed oppoſed to the greater number, as Maſter <hi>Garner</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>But it is uſed as oppoſed to the feweſt, and ſmalleſt number, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> and ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14 compare with <hi>Eſay.</hi> 45.22 23.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the word <hi>many,</hi> is uſed as a generall, out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, ſome ſpetiall are by degrees called; and ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares evidently in this <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>to beare the ſinnes of many,</hi> there is the generall, <hi>and he ſhall appeare the ſecond time without ſinne unto ſalvation, unto them that looke for him;</hi> there is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall called out of the generall, for he ſhall appeare to the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due alſo, though to their terrour, for denying him that ſo dearly bought them; and ſo, <hi>many,</hi> thus uſed, is both as generall and large, as <hi>all men,</hi> and ſerveth to amplifie the word <hi>all,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be a great and large number; though reaſon alſo might here be ſhowne, why it's rather ſaid <hi>many,</hi> then <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> hath changed this Text, in ſaying <hi>Chriſts offering &amp;c.</hi> is not expreſt in it in ſuch generall words, as <hi>all men &amp;c.</hi> is: And overthrown his whole buſineſſe in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this place for his helpe againſt the truth; where as it, with the whole chapter, juſtifieth the diſtinctions, yea, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he oppoſeth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I paſſe by his groſſe abuſe of 2 <hi>Timothie</hi> 1.9, 10. that he might blaſt the diſtinction, that where the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the manifeſtation of the grace of God in the appearing of CHRIST, ſaith of CHRIST, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47546:22"/>he hath <hi>abolliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpell,</hi> he put it in thus, and is then made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the hearts of thoſe to whom Jeſus Chriſt appeareth, abolliſhing death, and bringing life and immortality to light, <hi>page</hi> 11. I hope he is not of their mindes, that confeſſe not in their hearts Jeſus Chriſt, the Sonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be the Chriſt, and to have once dyed, and to be riſen and a live for ever more; but fancy only, a ſpirituall being, and frame in themſelves to be the Chriſt, and ſo to be now dying, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ſinne in them, and to be riſing in them yet, here he flies the Scripture language, and ſpeakes their language, ſo as at leaſt, making the fruit the foundation; I ſhould have looked that grace, or the feare of God, would have kept him from ſuch altering the words of the Holy Ghoſt: But becauſe every Reader may diſcerne this alteration, if he loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the text, I paſſe it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſt of all, he comes to oppoſe the diſtinction that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth difference between the Redemption, life, and juſtification that is in Chriſt for men, and the ſame upon, or in men, through the enjoyment of Chriſt: And this he doth from <hi>page</hi> 11. to <hi>page</hi> 24 in all which he ſeemes to wreſt the ſeverall Scriptures from what they ſay about the ſame: But all he hath ſaid doth not diſcourage, but incourage men ſtill to diſtinguiſh, and put great difference between the redemption &amp;c. in Chriſt, and the ſame (marke what I ſay not another, but the ſame) upon, or in men, through the enjoyment of Chriſt: for ſurely I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a Redemption, life, &amp;c. in him wrought for others, he was never in bonds or death for himſelfe, but for us, and our ſinnes; but it is a Redemption &amp;c. in us, given from another even him who was free, when wee were in bondage: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>and</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>John.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>and</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Redemption &amp;c. in him, which he by vertue of his ownblood and Sacrifice hath obtained, in and by himſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 12. But it is a Redemption in us, obtained by no vertue of ours, but by him, and in receit of him, by an unfained beleeving on him: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 10 43.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:47546:23"/>3.

But it is in us, as a receit in a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and though ſpringing, yet both receit, and ſpring, but a fruit of that of which he is the cauſe, &amp; in us according to a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>John</hi> 7.38, 39. <hi>and</hi> 1.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is in him abſolute perfect and compleat, in ſoule and body <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.1. <hi>and</hi> 8.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. but it is in us but as a firſt fruits, wee ſtill waiting for the Redemption of our body, and the compleat conformity to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. <hi>and</hi> 8 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is in him firſt, and that as a preparation for us, before wee partake of it: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19 20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1, 8. But it is in us after, when we by grace are brought into him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 8, 12, 17. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is in him, as a gift in a giver, God the Father gave him, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>And God hath given us eternall life in him,</hi> ſo that this life is in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. and God is making known, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and giving this life by the Goſpell, in which he hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt <hi>to be the propitiation for remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> though unbeleevers receive it not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>John</hi> 6.32, 36, and to ſpeake after the manner of men; It is in him, as a gift in, a Will, in the hands of an Executor given to many, to be given unto them, when upon the publiſhing the Will they come in to the Executor, and acknowledge the benefactor, which if they refuſe, when ſo made known and tendered, the refuſers may be refuſed.</p>
               <p>And ſo this Redemption, life, and juſtification is in Chriſt, as in the giver, ſome fruits whereof he extendeth to all men, (in preſervation of creatures for them, and their lives, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving meanes that they might know, ſeek, and receive the thing it ſelfe) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>and</hi> 36.6, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>and</hi> 17.26, 27, 30, 31. <hi>John</hi> 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47546:26"/>which he hath not anſwered as (by his pretence as a Chriſtian) he ought to have done.</p>
               <p>But he hath two reaſons he ſaith to (deny the words, and) manifeſt his forced and corrupt ſenſe: his firſt reaſon is,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the juſtification here mentioned, is that which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the higheſt degree in oppoſition to condemnation mentioned in the ſame verſe;</q> and this I grant, and it needs no deniall, for that is the condemnation which was of the publick man, and of all in the publick man; out of which yet there may be an eſcape by comming into Chriſt, and ſo this juſtification is of the ſecond publick man, and of all (nor of any but) in this publick man, of which many may miſſe by unbeleefe, not comming into him, and this ſuites ſomthing with that <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24 neither are beleevers ſpoken of in this 18. verſe, but in the 17, 19. with cleare diſtinction, mentioning receit, and ſo this verſe for juſtification in receit, to be parralleld with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>and</hi> 4.5. <hi>and</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. is grievouſly abuſed, ſeeing faith or beleeving is in them expreſly mentioned, and not ſo here.</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon is from the application of the Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here mentioned, unto the perſons here mentioned, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. but this is but a deviſed and fraudelent reaſon, for none denies that Beleevers doe receive even this very Juſtification, and are partakers thereof in themſelves before God; but what were they before they beleeved, or what are any other that yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not? What ſaith the Scripture <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 36. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. and this Juſtification in <hi>verſe</hi> 18. is not limmited, as in Chriſt for no more then thoſe that had it in themſelves; nor is it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that all unto whom this Juſtification in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick man did reach, ſhould be eternally ſaved any more, then it is affirmed of thoſe to whom the condemnation in the publick man did reach, that they ſhall be eternally damned: But as all men as ſoon as they have being from <hi>Adam,</hi> are in themſelves ſinners, ſo, ſo many as come to beleeve in Chriſt, are then made righteous in enjoyment and not before, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>chapter</hi> 4.21. And ſo ſpeaking of righteouſneſſe in life, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that only to them which receive aboundance of grace, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47546:27"/>of the gift of righteouſneſſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. which clearly holds forth the diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But his way of proving is weake and fraudelent alſo, like his reaſoning firſt he faith, this Juſtification &amp;c. is in <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 16.17, five times called a gift (it had been well he had minded in this gift, the diſtinction between grace, and the gift by grace, and between this gift, and the receit; mentioned in thoſe verſes) but what ſhould this inferre, doe they that beleeve Jeſus Chriſt to be the Saviour of the world, deny him to be the gift of God; or faith, yea, or any mercies extended through him, to be the gift by grace given of God: yet he cannot prove, that all that God giveth any, is by them received; the contrary appeareth <hi>John</hi> 6.32, 66. But it appeares he knoweth the originall; that the free gift came, mentioned <hi>verſe</hi> 18. is not the text but the Tranſlators words for ſupply of ſenſe put in.</p>
               <p>And yet ſecondly, in his way of proving, he hath put in <hi>judgement came, page</hi> 16. and three times urged <hi>grace came one;</hi> with an expoſition, came gloriouſly and powerfully upon them <hi>page</hi> 16. and once with an alteration, commeth, for came, preſent for preter-perfect tenſe, <hi>page</hi> 19, 20. And to make a right or full Babell, or confuſion of all diſtinctions, he maketh <hi>the gift came upon all men, and many ſhall be made righteous,</hi> all one <hi>page</hi> 19. To what purpoſe did this man flye ſo to the originall, <hi>page</hi> 40, 41. ſeeing here he maketh no account of it; but for his own purpoſe layes additions for foundations, though to any unprejudicated, it helpes him nothing at all; ſeeing that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever came on any in a publick man, it was at once and firſt, but the receite thereof is after and by degrees, and now by one, and then by another; ſo that the diſtinction remaines in and with the Text ſound againe in <hi>page</hi> 21. he refers his Reader to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſayings about 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. for his clearing that place from proving the diſtinction, but there he hath not done it; and how he clips the quotation to leave out one verſe, to hide that he oppoſeth, for it is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. for in theſe two verſes is expreſſe, <hi>that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelfe, verſe</hi> 19. and that ſome of the world he hath <hi>reconciled to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, verſe</hi> 18. there is a reconciliation wrought by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47546:27"/>God in Chriſt <hi>verſe</hi> 19. and a reconciliation wrought by Chriſt of ſome men from the world unto God, <hi>verſe</hi> 18. for proofe and clearing whereof, enough is ſaid in the oppoſed Treatiſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>page</hi> 66, 67. and Poſtſcript, to all which he hath anſwered nothing; though that ſaid, both prove the diſtinction, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow his after ſaying; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. this place is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by him, <hi>page</hi> 21, 22, 23. to hide the diſtinction with his conceptions; but let the place it ſelfe be veiwed, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>He that beleeveth on the Sonne of God hath the witneſſe in himſelfe, he that beleeveth not God hath made him a lyer, becauſe be beleeveth not the record God gave of his Sonne;</hi> is not here a clear diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a record given of God to men, and the receit thereof by men; And again concerning thoſe men to, or for whom the record is given, ſome beleeve, and ſome beleeve it not; is not here another diſtinction, and marke that he ſaith not, that he that beleeveth God or his ſayings or teſtimony, hath the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in himſelfe, for he may yet be ſhort of that, though he ſhall doe well to take heed to that record, <hi>as to a light ſhining in a darke place</hi> (for the word, or record, is a light) <hi>till the day dawn and the day ſtar ariſe in his heart:</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>John</hi> 8.30, 31, 36. <hi>But he that beleeveth on the Sonne of God,</hi> that through the grace ſeen, and beleeved in the record, is overcome to beleeve, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him for eternall life, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27.) he hath the witneſſe in himſelfe, as <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>and</hi> 5.1. Again mind that he ſaith not, he that beleeveth not on the Sonne of God hath made him a lyer, for if a man beleeve God his ſaying, or the record God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his Sonne, though he yet want light, and power for a through and unfeined dependance on him for eternall life, yet if he take heed to this teſtimony or word and record, <hi>as to a light ſhining in a dark place; till the day dawn and the day-ſtarre ariſe in his heart;</hi> God wil not charge him w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> this great ſin of making God a lyer: But he doth well, and ſhall in due ſeaſon experiment that light and power that will inable him to depend on Chriſt, and build on him, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 40.31. <hi>and</hi> 49.23. <hi>and</hi> 50.10. But he ſaith, <hi>He that beleeveth not God (and beleeveth not his record) hath made him a lyer:</hi> And why is he charged with ſo great a ſinne, is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47546:28"/>there was no truth of good in the record for him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Chriſt for him, farre be it; no, it is becauſe he beleeves not the record God gave of his Sonne, as 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>and this is the record (that God hath given of his Sonne, that God hath given to us eternall life</hi> (is not here the gift) <hi>and this life is in his Sonne</hi> (is not here he in whom it is, and where God hath given it, and put it for us that wee might have it) ſo that here is the gift diſtinctly, and is not the receit as diſtinct in <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne hath not life:</hi> Lo, is not here the diſtinction again between beleevers and unbeleevers, is not the having the Sonne, the beleeving on the Sonne, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. and have not ſuch belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the witneſſe within them, and eternall life, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 33, 36. and is not, the not having the Sonne, the not beleeving on him, <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. and are not ſuch deſtitute of eternall life; and that not becauſe it is not in Chriſt for them; but becauſe they beleeve not on him, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19, 36. And he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not to day, and ſo yet hath not the Sonne, may he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to morrow, and ſo have both the Sonne, and life in him, and how, if it were not before in him? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25 26. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.12. ſo that the diſtinction is here clearly held forth, and that life is larger in Chriſt, then in the receit: and Mr. <hi>Garners</hi> hovering about, as a fraid to looke in the text, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſome part of the truth which wee deny not, that he might deny ſome part that wee confeſſe; hath hurt us nothing.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas he feares my thoughts of ſtrengthening the diſtinction, by ſaying, there is juſtification in Chriſt for all perſons: to this I anſwer, I know not where I ſaid ſo, nor I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe doth he, for I beleeve ſpirits to be perſons, and I doe not beleeve Juſtification to be in Chriſt for the fallen Angels, not for all, nor for ſome of all ſortes, nor for any one of them: and likewiſe, though I ſaid, and writ for men, yea, for all men, while they are no worſe then men, yet I have explicated the ſame, and affirmed that though life be in Chriſt for all, yet ſome have ſo rejected him, while he was ſtriving with them to have brought them to life, that for their oppoſition, and rejecting of the truth and grace of God, that he hath given them up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47546:28"/>and they are become of the ſerpentine ſeed, and ſo the dore of life is ſhut againſt them, and though this life be ſtill in Chriſt for all men, yet not now for them, who though ſtill called men, yet are, and are called alſo ſomthing worſe then men, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſonnes of <hi>Beliall &amp;c.</hi> yet they are perſons ſtill, as I have ſhewn in the oppoſed Treatiſe, <hi>chapter</hi> 11. <hi>page</hi> 56 62. It is not uprightly or fairely done, to alter and change mens termes and phraſes when he is dealing with them: But let the termes be as they are, for all mankind, and I will mind what he ſaith. <hi>page</hi> 23. <q>He deſires to conſider, that theſe words <hi>In Chriſt,</hi> when they are ſpoken of, or applyed unto redemption, Juſtification, Salvation and the like, they doe properly ſignifie by, or through Chriſt; and holds forth unto us a reall, glorious and ſure enjoyment, which thoſe have of redemption; Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation in Chriſt: of whom the things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that if I had not met with ſubtilty and fraud in his poſitions and termes before, I ſhould marvell much at this.</p>
               <p>Why he puts down his buſineſſe thus, That theſe words <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> when ſpoke of, or applyed unto redemption &amp;c. will he grant it concernes all men, when that preparation in him is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched as ready for them that yet have it not. and they called to it, though ſome refuſe, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 9 1, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. and divers more places: then he muſt unſay the drift of his whole Book, if he grant not this, he goeth wrong for his proofes, and ſpeaketh fraudelently.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Why doth he only mentioned theſe words. <hi>In Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47546:29"/>when in the text laſt named the words were, <hi>in his Sonne,</hi> and ſo not limmitting to particular words, but minding the perſon of Chriſt; and ſo <hi>in Chriſt, in Ieſus Chriſt, in his Sonne, in him, in whom &amp;c.</hi> are all one, which by his own practice is granted; therefore let not his Reader be dazled with his ſingling out words.</p>
               <p>Why doth he ſay the words, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> ſo applyed, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignify by, and through Chriſt, If he meane it of the work which he only in himſelfe in his own perſonall body, and by himſelfe did accompliſh and compleat with God for men; and of that fulneſſe of power, authority and grace he hath received in our nature in his own perſon, that he may govern and diſpenſe, then he ſpeakes untruly; for though by and through be true, and good words, and included, yet <hi>in him,</hi> is the moſt proper tearme, when wee ſpeak of that in himſelfe, and ſo uſed by the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>and</hi> 2.3, 9. But if he grant a redemption and life in this ſenſe, he overthroweth all he hath hitherto ſaid, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, he denies the foundation laid by God in Sion, to be ſuch a foundation as may be for any that are not yet come in, in the call of them, a foundation for, and of repentance, faith, &amp;c. or for any ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in, to be built upon: &amp; denieth him to be a dore of life for any not yet entered; and the true Vine, or Olive tree, for any yet to be grafted in, that are not in him already; and ſo taketh away the key of knowledge from men, and ſhuts the dore of life againſt them: but if he mean it of the vertue and power of this redemption &amp; life in Chriſt, in the fruites thereof in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, of errour, for in receit of this redemption, beſides the faith and hope in him, which it effecteth; it doth worke in the beleever in all his faculties, powers and members, melting and ſoftening the heart, renewing the diſpoſition, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and ſo redeemeth and ſaveth from the polutions of the World, the tyranny of Satan, hardneſſe of heart, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous luſts, and brings up, and unto love of brethren, and works of adoration and mercy: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 28. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. In which alſo the beleevers faith is juſtified to be unfained and lively, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.19. <hi>&amp;c</hi> But I hope Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> will not ſay this is their life and juſtification before God, in which they glory and reſt, and approach to God in confidence on, though that for which they are thankfull to God; and though they may be ſaid to have this in Chriſt, becauſe it is effected in them from his preſence by ſpirit in them, <hi>and that which is borne of the ſpirit is ſpirit,</hi> yet this is properly ſaid to be by, and through Chriſt, and ſo this interpretation of, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> by him, remaines darke and boubtfull.</p>

               <p>The whole drift of the Treatiſe was to teſtifie the truth of theſe two places of Scripture, according to the ſenſe the words import; and that was in my Title (though another that is true alſo was put on it) and the places were 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. who gave himſelfe a ranſome for all; And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.

The word, <hi>All,</hi> in Scriptures upon ſome occaſions is to be taken for All perſons from firſt to laſt: but he neither ſhewes when, where, nor on what occaſions, nor ſhewes any ground, or rule that may ſtand to know it by; but leaves that for a Pope to canonize the text, and tell us when, where, and in what ſenſe the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47546:33"/>truth: But the Holy Ghoſt hath given us a ground, or rule which will neither deceive us, nor leave us at uncertainty; And the ſame rule will ſerve us to underſtand the words world, and nations, when they are ſpoken of by God, and his making, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, ſhewing favour too; and judging of them by Chriſt: And ſo nations, as wel as world, when ſo ſpoken of in indefinite affirmations admits no exception of any, but God in Chriſt, as <hi>Act.</hi> 17 24.26 21. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 86 9.

               <p>But now if the word World be ſpoken of by God, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſome times, as the world that then was and periſhed by water; the world that now is, and is reſerved unto Aire; The world to come, we underſtand it accordingly, yet as generally, and largely, as the words ſo ſpoken will beare ſutable to God: And ſo when nations are ſpoken of narratively in reſpect of ſome things paſt, or prophetically in reſpect of ſome things to be after done, and yet in time alſo, we underſtand it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet in the largeſt ſenſe the words ſo ſpoken will beare.</p>
               <p>But now when God ſpeaketh of All men, All nations, or the world, concerning the Babylonian, Perſian, Grecian, or Roman Monarcks, we have no ground, not reaſon to underſtand it ſo largely, as when hee ſpeakes of Chriſt, much leſſe when vaine men, or weake men, ſpeake of all men, or the world: yea, even Gods Commands to his ſervants, to preach the Goſpell to every creature, and in All the world, wee underſtand not in ſo large a ſenſe, as when God ſpeakes of the perſon of Chriſt his Sonne, and his workes by him; but then, by All men, every man, The world, we underſtand All where they come, one or other of his ſervants from age to age; And this is an uſuall thing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and among men.

And that Church but a part of the whole Church which is but one, and the calling a part by the name of the whole, doth not deny the being of the whole to Annihilate the reſidue; and limit all to that part: But the being of the whole gives ground of truth for ſo calling the part by ſuch a name; And ſo that Chriſt dyed for All.

                  <p n="1">1 About the true Prophets and the falſe in former times, in this word <hi>But there were falſe Prophets,</hi> the true Prophets did not ſtudy, or invent that which they propheſied, nor ſpeak, or write by their own will; but they waited &amp; attended diligently what the ſpirit did ſignifie, and ſo ſpeake and write, as they were inſpired &amp; moved by the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. and ſo the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2, 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.

But though he did ſpeak many things in parrables before his death and reſurrection, yet he left in charge with his Diſciples, to whom he promiſed, and after his aſcenſion did ſend forth his ſpirit to teach them all he had ſaid to them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.26. that what he told them in darkneſſe they ſhould ſpeak in the light, and what they heard in the eare, that to preach on the houſe tops <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.17. and is not this given as a reaſon, that the knowledge given them is a light ſet on a candle-ſtick, that they that enter in may ſee the light, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.10, 16. And have not the Apoſtles profeſſed to have kept this charge; to have uſed great plainnes of ſpeech, &amp; not to put a vail over their face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12, 13. and to have renounced the hidden things of dishoneſty, not walking in craftineſſe, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifeſtation of the truth commending themſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. and to write none other thing, then thoſe to whom they writ did read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. and ſo, as when they read they might underſtand their knowledge &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.4. &amp; proteſted before God, the things they writ they did not lye; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11, 20.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to proceed, he ſpeakes in a plain contradicting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the Holy Ghoſt; who ſaith expreſly, <hi>That Chriſt dyed for the ungodly, Rom.</hi> 5.6 <hi>For the unjuſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.18. And yet ſaith again as expreſly, that none ſuch hath any inheritance in the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. and that ſuch (that is, while ſuch, or as ſuch) ſhall not inherit &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10 <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And that thoſe who now doe inherit, were ſome times ſuch, but then they did not inherit, but now they are waſhed &amp;c. and ſo made meet to inherit 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12.13. The holy Ghoſt never faſtening the inheritance, and ſuch intereſt on this word, or bare act, Chriſt dyed for them; But on his gracious application of the vertue of his death, and reſurrection, inabling them to beleeve, and making on in Chriſt: <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. ſo that heerin his ſenſe appeares unſavory in ſuch an affirmation of Chriſt dying for all: But to come cloſer to him, in that wherein hee would ſtrive to wind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out, by ſaying; though the word <hi>For,</hi> implyes not ſuch an intereſt, That all have at preſent, yet it implies that at one time or other, they ſhall, that are concerned in that word <hi>For,</hi> ſhall have ſuch an intereſt: I ſhall therefore let the Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>

                  <p>That Jeſus Chriſt, by his death and reſurrection, hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out the ſting and curſe of the firſt death, ſo as in it ſelfe, it is to no man a curſe, nor is able for ever to detain thoſe that dye, But they ſhall be raiſed, and made a live again, and ſo it is made leſſe dreadfull, more eaſie, and but as paſſage to immortality to every man, is a truth affirmed in Scripture (though by Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> denyed) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22-54, 55, 56. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. though the choyce benefit be to Beleevers, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1-8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57, 58. ſo that through the mediation of Chriſt, and only his own perſonal death is made ſavory, &amp; gainfull to them <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8-10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. but their-through even their own dyings alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11 <hi>to</hi> 18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 5-9.

But the words are plaine, to ſet forth that exalted one, even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whoſe exaltation he ſpeaketh; and how farre the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all to him, is already fulfilled, concerning himſelfe: And in this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 9 two things he ſhewes concerning him, whom by faith wee now ſee crowned with glory, as firſt, the end why he was abaſed, namely, That he migh ſuffer death, <hi>he was made a little lower then the Angels,</hi> verſe 7. and this the ſame hee that is crowned with glory, as <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Who was made lower then the Angels,</hi> for ſuffering death, that he might ſuffer death, and ſo overcome death, as <hi>verſe.</hi> 9.14.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the manner, &amp; for whom, and that was, <hi>That by the grace of God he ſhould taſt death for every man,</hi> agreeable to that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 14 15. and ſo the words, <hi>crowned with glory and honour,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not that it was ſo before his ſuffering death, but referring to that ſaid <hi>verſe</hi> 7 may be read as in a parenthiſis; and yet truly he was much glorified, in being made ſuch a publike man, and filled with might, to ſuffer, and overcome ſuch a death, and ſo to read the words in order, Then <hi>taſting Death,</hi> is not onely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47546:52"/>dying, but alſo inſtructive to us in two things about his death, as namely;</p>

Of one that hath taken ſinne out of the way: 2. Of one that doth it, that is ordained to, and able for it, and will do it in all them that come to him: 3. Of one that hath done it in all that have come in to him; And in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47546:57"/>all theſe ſenſes, it is meant of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For <hi>Taking out of the way:</hi> We have two things to note, how ſinne lyeth in the way between God and men, to make a ſeparation, and ſo to ſtop the paſſages, and make it impaſſible, either for the mercies of God to bee extended to men, or for mens approach to God: And theſe are;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That great offence of our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> by which ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſin; ſo as all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in their receiving of their being from him, are guilty of, and defiled with and under the power of ſin, and ſo ſubject to Law, and Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.18, 19 And the truth of God neceſſitates his Death; and his Juſtice neceſſitates his ſuffering the curſe; and till both bee done, and overcome, there can no mercy bee ſhewne to men, nor is there any paſſage open for their approach to God; The Winter abides for impaſſibility of the way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Now Jeſus Chriſt as a publike man in the nature and ſtead of all, being manifeſted to take, away our ſins, and being made a curſe for us; and in riſing Juſt, and a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, offering himſelfe a ſacrifice to God, hath done this work, fulfilled truth, and ſatisfie Juſtice, and ſo mercy and truth meet; and truth is ſprung out of the earth, and hee hath aboliſhed death, removed out of the way that which was contrary to us, opened a gate to life, procured mercy to be ſhewed us, ſo as the Winter is paſt, the way paſſible, and righteouſneſſe flows down from heaven, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. and 145. So far are all men indebted to Jeſus Chriſt for ſo taking ſn out of the way, that mercies are ſhewne them through him, and a gate opened that they might enter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. which might move to ſubmit to him; Though Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> by denying this, teach the greateſt part of men to deny the Lord that bought them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Doore opened through Chriſt, and theſe mercies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended teſtifying of him, and calling to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 14 17. and 17.24.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. God being well pleaſed in his Son, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, lookes downe from heaven upon the ſons of men, to ſee if there bee any that by all this his goodneſſe extended, will underſtand, and ſeeke after him; but alas, men comming to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47546:57"/>and the light of his mercies ſhining on them, they yet abide in darkneſſe, impenitencie, and unbeliefe, hardning their hearts againſt his mercies, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. and 53. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 10.19. And this moſt properly is called, <hi>The ſinne of the world, John</hi> 1.4, 5-10, 11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. And its terrible to perſiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.21. For this provokes more highly then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſo as from the love God beares to his Son; it would ſtop all continuance of mercies and meanes, and cauſe the ſhutting of the doore to repentance and life, but that even this Jeſus, againſt whom they ſo ſin, doth mediate for them by vertue of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and takes this ſin alſo out of the way; that hee procures lengthening the dayes of his patience, and continuace of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and meanes with ſome ſtrife of ſpirit to them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 13 6 9. <hi>Eſay</hi> 53 12. And for the taking away of their ſins, are all men beholding to Chriſt: yea, this may bee often done, even for ſome that have ſinned deeply, and though crying in their diſtreſſe, yet their heart, not upright with him; And they may come after, for provoking him that ſo oft forgave, and tooke away wrath, to be abhorred. See this expreſſ. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 37, 38, &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14 17 20. And the more and ofter Chriſt hath ſo taken ſin out of the way, and removed wrath from men, the more are they engaged to ſeeke and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt, nor can all Mr. <hi>Garners</hi> glorious words free them from that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For having fitneſſe, power and readineſſe, to take away ſin even out of the conſciences, and nature of men, and ſo to be ordained, and ſet apart as the <hi>Hee;</hi> and the only <hi>He,</hi> that both can, and will do it in all that in beleeving come to him; and is ſo ſet forth, and pointed out, that men might know where to ſeeke and find this; and this alſo is Jeſus Chriſt the Lambe of God, by reaſon of what he hath ſuffered, and done, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; He is the Atonement, and propitiation for our ſins, even when we beleeve not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 24 and 5 18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. and ſet forth alſo to be a Propitiation (which ſure he is before ſet forth) through faith in the blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25 26. And ſo there is bleſſing in him for all Nations, ſo as who ever of them, though ungodly, are by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47546:58"/>his grace drawne in to beleeve on him that juſtifies the ungodly; he receives remiſſion &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43-46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. And ſo is he ſet forth, <hi>The Lambe of God which &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now here is to be noted; that as Jeſus both ſo hath in the two former reſpects taken, &amp; taketh away the ſin of the world; and likewiſe both is, and is ſet forth, the Propitiation for their ſins; that hath propiated, yea, even the Propitiation through faith in his blood, able, &amp; ready to take ſin out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, and nature of all that by his goodneſſe come in to him in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. even ſo alſo, this is noted, and that alſo upon the very ſame ground.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe who by all this goodneſſe of God in &amp; through Chriſt, and by all theſe engagements vnto Chriſt, by what hee hath done for them, and doth to them, and hath to beſtow on them, are not, and will not be drawne from their own wayes to him, but loving darkneſſe rather then light, remaine impenitent, and unbeleeving, &amp; ſo they remain ſtill under guilt of ſin in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9. Under condemnation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18, 19. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath, and cannot ſee life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.36. and therefore under ſin and condemnation, and wrath, and cannot ſee life; even becauſe by all this light and mercy ſhewne, they have not been prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with to beleeve on his Name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18.36. &amp; 16.8. and ſo they remaine of the world ſtill, lying in wickedneſſe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſuch as are overcome by his Spirit, in the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his ſo great grace to beleeve on him; they though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, of the world, and ſinners when they are comming in to him, yet being prevailed with to come in beleeving on him, he forgiveth, juſtifieth, waſheth with the vertue of his blood from the ſins of the world, and ſo enableth them to receive remiſſion of ſins, and to depend on him for eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.22.25. &amp; 5.1-6. 8-10. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. And ſo in all and every reſpect hee is moſt truly called, <hi>The Lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinne of the world,</hi> or ſins of the world.</p>
                  <p>But now this is to be farther noted; That ſo many as are by his grace brought in to beleeve on him, and ſo united to him as they are clenſed from the ſin of the world, and begin to partake
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47546:58"/>of the Divine Nature, being borne from above, and ſo waſhed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.5. even ſo though they be ſtill in the world; yet they are not of the world, nor according to the account of God, and thoſe taught of God, now reckoned of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.19. &amp; 17.14. but brought out from the power of darkneſſe and Satan, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.13. in which before they were, and the world ſtill lyeth. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.

So that though in ſpirit, and in reſpect of their union with Chriſt and ſtate of ſon-ſhip, and being reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after him, and ſo juſtified; yet in reſpect, and the evils of their wayes, with which God is not pleaſed, nor doth juſtifie; but teſtifie diſpleaſure againſt; they need ſtill to have their feet waſhed, and their wayes healed, and ſo their evils, and ſins to bee ſtill taken away, till they, and all that which concerneth them be perfected, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14.24. And on this ground of the former done, it is beleeved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. and prayed for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.4-6. And this doth Jeſus Chriſt by his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living to entercede for ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.

                  <p n="2">2. He hath fully denyed all that preparation and proviſion of Redemption, Reconciliation, Atonement, righteouſneſſe, life, and Spirit, which God by vertue of the precious blood and Sacrifice of Chriſt preſented to him, hath made in Chriſt to be preached to men, to invite them to come in to him and receive it, yea, for any, but thoſe that are come in, and have it already; for hee affirmed that there is no taking away of ſinne, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Redemption, or Atonement, wrought for any, but by the ſprinckling, or application of the blood of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) which is ſure in their in-comming, and within them) and ſo hath denyed the truth of theſe Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14 5 9, 10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.14.19, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1.14.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47546:61"/>neither is his blood any other way of uſe to us, neither doth it any other way ſpeak good for us before God, but as it's ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon our conſciences by the power of the Spirit: And ſo he hath denyed the truth of that affirmed in <hi>John</hi> 1.4 11. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 75 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>and</hi> 17 26.31.</p>

                  <p>Thus hath he altogether denyed, and raced the Goſpell, as it is ſet forth to be preached to unbeleevers, as a truth, that they might beleeve, and in beleeving might receive, and for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving be under ſinne; for he hath affirmed, their is no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no Reconciliation, no Atonemen, (and ſo no ſinne taken out of the way, no pardon, no life obtained, wrought, or made with God by Chriſt, or received into the hands of Chriſt, for men to diſpence to ſuch as beleeve, that it might be preached to them in his name, that they might beleeve (as <hi>Paul</hi> did to ſuch as yet beleeved not, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36, 37, 38.) but this mans ſayings give out, that of all this there is nothing done with God for any; by Chriſt his Dying, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, offering Sacrifice, and mediation by vertue of all with God, nothing hath his blood done for any, till by ſpirit, it be ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on their conſcience, nor doth it any thing with God for any by his preſentment of it to God, nor any other way but by ſprinckling upon the conſcience, and ſure that is not till they

                  <p>Again, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer and overcome, <hi>and ſee his ſeed, and of the travell of his ſoule,</hi> and that he ſhould be Gods ſalvation, <hi>and ſhew forth judgement to the Gentils,</hi> and that God would make a new Teſtamentall Covenant with his People, <hi>and power out his Spirit on all fleſh,</hi> was ſtill further revealed to, and by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>Iſay</hi> 53. <hi>and</hi> 42.19 6. <hi>and</hi> 49 6 <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.

M.</hi> hath laboured to maintaine for how elſe will he underſtand the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the death of Chriſt, wee are not queſtioning, what is the ſufficiency of God the Creator, as Creator; The Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Sacrifice of Chriſt is certainly a creature; though ſuch as in which the Creator is yet as Chriſt is the firſt borne of every creature; The firſt borne from the dead, the ſecond man, made a quickning Spirit; ſo all this in him a new creation; now how there ſhould be a ſufficiency in any created being, though poſſeſſed with God for redeeming any, for which there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor ever was any intention, or will of the Creator, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand indeed if he had ſaid, it might have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if God had ſo willed, I might, and would have ſpared this &amp; given another Anſwer: But he plainly confeſſeth, There was value and worth in Chriſts Death (in regard of the ſufficiency and excellency of it) for the redeeming al the men in the world; And if there was ſuch value and worth for ſufficiency in it. It is ſo in it ſtill (compare <hi>John</hi> 1.4.5. with 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1, 2 3.) <hi>The Word of the Lord endureth for ever, I ſay</hi> 40 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24, 25. And we are to follow thoſe the end of whoſe doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is, to ſet forth <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, The ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13 8. And ſo whoſoever miſſe, it is for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47546:74"/>not receiving the tenders of it in the meanes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23, 24, &amp;c. So that Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> in this ſaying hath ſecretly granted that which he openly oppoſeth; but yet he ſaith, whether Chriſt in Gods intention, and his owne performance ſo payed a ranſome for all, and every particular man, as thereby to make ſatisfaction, and procure reconciliation with God for them, is the thing in queſtion: This <hi>T. M.</hi> undertakes to prove, ſaith Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> He meanes not that <hi>T. M.</hi> goeth about to prove that this is the thing in queſtion that reſts for himſelf to prove; But that <hi>T. M.</hi> undertakes to prove this thing that is in queſtion; but he ſhould either have put downe <hi>T. M.</hi> his owne expreſſions, or elſe not after have ſlandered him, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 5, 6, 7. ſaying, That Chriſt enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reconcile all men to God by the reconciliation wrought in his body with God for men; which, ſaith he, are <hi>Tho. Moore</hi> his owne words, but as hee hath annexed them, they are Mr. <hi>Tho. Whitfeild</hi> his owne ſurmiſes: And therefore ſeeing he hath not ſet downe the queſtion either as Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> did, To which I yeelded in my Booke, nor as I there expreſſed it, nor kept cloſe in his Treatiſe in anſwering to that hee expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as mine; I muſt a little open the buſineſſe, before I yeeld him this to be mine; And ſo I confeſſe my ſelfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I underſtand and beleeve, that in the beginning God made one man, a living ſoule, and that he made him righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and a publike man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. That he made them ſuperiour, and inferiour, male, and female, fit for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by generation, and called their name <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. &amp; 5.2. And that God at the firſt created all men in his creation of this man, and made all men righteous, in making this man righteous, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7 29. So as what this <hi>Adam</hi> was in his publique place in which he then ſtood all men were in him, for he was all men; and what God adorned, and furniſhed him withall, he did it in him to all men: And the oportunity of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tree of Life; with the charge not to eat of the tree of Knowledge of good and evill, and affirmation of Death in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dye in the very day he ſhould eat thereof; given to this man was given to all men in this man; And this publique man eating of the fruit of the forbidden tree; he ſinned, and ſo loſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47546:74"/>the Image of God out of his heart, and fell under the guilt, and power of ſin; and ſo under the power of the Law and of death, &amp;c. And what he did, all men did in him; ſo as in him all men ſinned, and fell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. And the Almighty convicting him of ſin; convicted all men of ſin, ſo that by this one offence, or the offence of this one, unto all men to condemnation, that is, on all men in a publique man; yet not at the firſt on them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and particulars, yet ſo as all the individuals, when ever they come forth by propogation from him, as they are of him in that Nature they partake of, and are under the guilt, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame miſery in bondage to law, ſin, and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. So that by reaſon of the ſentence gone forth from the Almighty, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2.17. (more unalterable then that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, Heſt.</hi> 3 &amp; 8) Truth and Juſtice required a preſent impoſing of the execution of that Death and curſe, which is the firſt Death according to the juſt judgement of God, without a mediator, and that all men muſt have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; if God had not found out a remedie, for without ſheading blood, no Remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. But now this I beleeve; that as God in his purpoſe of making man, did ſee that man would fall: So in his purpoſe, and Councell he provided the remedy in his Son before the world was, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. And preſently upon the fall in the very ſame moment this buſineſſe was done and acted, in reſpect of agreement, conceipt, Tender, and acceptation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and Chriſt the Sonne of God, to take into union of Perſon the nature of man, to be made fleſh, under the Law, and beare the imputation of ſin; and ſo to dye, and riſe, and offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for man, which God accepted, and ſo filled him in the nature of man with all fulneſſe of grace and truth: ſo that here is a propitiation, life from the dead, and a new creation in; And a new heaven, and earth for this ſecond Man; And ſpirit to quicken, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.10. So that here are two men, two <hi>Adams,</hi> the firſt, the laſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. &amp;c. So that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Death, Reſurrection, and Sacrifice of Chriſt was from the beginning, ſo as thereby men were either ſaved, or left to the judgement of Chriſt; Though the fruitfulneſſe thereof was neither ſo apparant, nor abundant till it was really
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47546:75"/>acted in our nature by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.1-17. <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2. ſo that there is no Divinity in this Argument of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> That becauſe many were damned before Chriſt actually Dyed, therefore Chriſt dyed not for them, <hi>page</hi> 4.36, 37. <hi>page</hi> 11. <hi>l.</hi> 4. hee might as well have ſaid m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny were ſaved before Chriſt actually dyed, therefore he dyed not for them: But paſſing ſuch Arguments as of no force to enlightened beleevers, Scripture ſheweth us two things wrought by God in the gift of his Son, and obtained of God, and effected by Chriſt, by vertue of his Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and offering himſelfe a Sacrifice to God, and receit of Spirit in the man: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A ſupportation of the old or firſt creation for a time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. In which there is both time, and ſpace given that men might repent and come in to their Lord, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. And alſo meanes and ſome motion of Spirit to ſead, and move to repentance, and ſeeking the Lord, <hi>Rom</hi> 2 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 14 17. &amp; 17 26, 27. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. And 2. A new creation, in which is pardon, Peace, juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, life from the dead, or eternall life, and inheritance, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.5 which all that by grace are brought into union with Chriſt partaking of, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5 17. Here in this life in ſpirit in a firſt fruits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 10.23. In the Reſurrection in fulneſſe both in ſoule and body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. Now in theſe two men, the firſt, and the laſt man, all men are conſiderable; The firſt a naturall man; The ſecond a ſpirituall; In the firſt difference of ſexe, and degree; In the ſecond, not ſo. The firſt fallen: The ſecond ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken, hath reſtored that fallen nature: And thereby preſerveth the firſt with that creation for a time, ſo as genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come forth from him, the diſtinctions of ſexe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees remaining preſerved, and ordered by him for the time, and hath alſo a new creation for all that come forth of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and by the means he uſeth come in to him; But as none come in to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that came not forth of the firſt; ſo none come forth of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe nature the ſecond hath not taken, &amp; for whom he hath done nothing by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they might partake of him, and for refuſall thereof be juſtly judged by him: but theſe two <hi>Adams</hi> are not both naturall to have their ſeverall poſterities by generation. The ſecond is a ſpirituall man,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47546:75"/>and his ſeed is of ſuch as come in to him by regeneration; It was therefore ſomething unſavoury, and of no force to prove any thing, ſo to expteſſe his compariſon, and the oppoſition of the two <hi>Adams</hi> with their ſeverall poſterities, and then mention the ſuppoſition of a third, <hi>page</hi> 68. <hi>line</hi> 17, 18. unleſſe Mr. <hi>W.</hi> could ſhew a poſterity comming forth of the loynes of the Man Chriſt, or a Generation comming in to him, who never came forth of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and ſo were firſt of his poſterity: But to the buſineſſe as I am helped to underſtand; but by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and alſo by reaſon ſubdued to beleeve God in his owne ſayings.</p>
            <p>If Jeſus Chriſt in the beginning did by his conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God his Father become the ſecond Man, the laſt publique Man, and ſo under-tooke for the firſt man, the firſt publique man, who was all men: Then he under-tooke for all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.45, 46, 47. If he tooke the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that was all men, and not only a part of that nature, or ſome part of the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> but the whole nature of whole <hi>Adam,</hi> then he took the nature of all men Luke 3.23.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. If Jeſus Chriſt became under the Law, and ſtood in the ſtead, and bare the ſins of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and dyed for his ſins, in whom all ſinned, and fell under Law, and whoſe ſin, was the ſin of all men: Then ſurely, hee was made under the Law for, and ſtood in the ſtead, and bare the ſins, and dyed for the ſins of all men; Though the gift in, and by Chriſt exceed the offence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. And if Jeſus Chriſt took not on him the difference of ſexes and degrees, or any of the excellencies, or furniture of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but only the nature, which was one in both ſexes, and each degree; Then he came, and dyed for all men in both ſexes, and every degree, not ſo much reſpecting ſexes, or degrees, as the nature of men for whom, and for whoſe ſins he came, and dyed, and ſo for them, as men, ungodly, and ſinners, and not as elect veſſels, and a holy generation, though to make ſuch; and even from the roofe and beginning of all it is evident; That Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond publique man undertook as the ſecond man; A publique perſon for the firſt man a publique perſon, and ſo for all that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47546:76"/>were in him, and by propogation to come of him; that they might not periſh in this firſt judgement and death, but to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him into his diſpoſe; to preſerve alive a time; that they might live to him in this life, and after death to raiſe them, and bring them alive before him, to be judged by him, in another judgement to another life, or to another death, according to the Goſpell: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9-12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11 14, 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2 7-11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. and ſo the holy Ghoſt, teacheth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the buſineſſe, ſaying, <hi>As by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneoſſe of one unto all men to juſtification of life: Rom.</hi> 5.18. that is, as is aforeſaid in the other; in the publicke man that undertooke for all men, and that ſo as their lives are preſerved a time, and the old creation for them, that ſuch as come into him by the meanes he uſeth, while he preſerveth them in this old creation, may partake of the new creation in him, and ſuch as periſh in rebellion againſt him, may be brought to another judgement, and ſentenced to a ſecond Death. And ſo, &amp; in this ſenſe, Jeſus Chriſt hath dyed, and given himſelfe a ranſome for All men; ſo as he hath made an atonement with God, and is himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the propitiation for their ſinnes, that it may be declared or teſtified in ſome fruites of his goodneſſe, to lead to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſeeking the Lord, that ſo ſuch as are by grace brought in to beleeve, may be reconciled unto God, and receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, and eternall life, and thoſe that periſh in refuſall and rebellion, be juſtly ſent down to a ſecond Death; which is a foundation and ground of, and motive to repentance, faith, and obedience for all men, ſet forth in the Goſpell; ſhewing in all this, their obligation to Chriſt, with incouragement to come in to Chriſt, and terrour to all that rebell: If Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> his expreſſions may be taken in this ſenſe, it is yeelded as a true report (or elſe not) for this is that which Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> oppoſeth and which <hi>T. M.</hi> endevoureth to ſhew proved in the ſayings of holy Scripture, for otherwiſe to prove, he is ſtill leſſe; being no Linguiſt, for knowledge of divers tongues; no Arthiſt in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, either according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Ramus;</hi> nor learned in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> either morrall, politicall or naturall, either <hi>Epicuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47546:76"/>Pithagorean, Stoicke,</hi> or <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> or were he, yet he could not thinke meet by theſe, to ſquare, mould, and prove Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but only what God ſaith in his word, as he is helped to underſtand, he deſireth to beleeve, and takes his ſayings to be proofe enough, and of more worth then all the reaſons and arguments of men againſt them. But Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> ſaith, that for proofe, <hi>T. M.</hi> makes uſe of three things, which he makes the principall ground of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That which he cals the firſt ground for <hi>T. M.</hi> his proofe is, The diſtinction between the Redemption, reconciliation, and ſalvation, which Jeſus Chriſt effected in his own body with God for men, and that he effected by his Spirit in men God; this ſaith Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> is not agreeable to Scripture, To which I anſwer, I have been ſo told by ſuch whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth, as lay preachers, but not by any profeſt Divines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I read it in Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This diſtinction, and foure more, one about the diſtinct ends of his death, another the diſtinct manner of mentioning thoſe ends; another about the divers waies of propounding his death, and another about the difference of the extent and force of the ſame word in Scripture; I uſed for clearing the buſineſſe in ſtating the queſtion: But ſeeing ſo many of thoſe he reproacheth as lay preachers, affirme them my proofes, and now it is ſo affirmed by two Clerks profeſſed Divines, though of contrary judgement and practice, let them ſo ſtand, each of the five diſtinctions being of the like force to prove, and foure of them not faulted by Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This diſtinction he faulteth, is in the Treatiſe ſhewn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in the Scripture there quoted, <hi>page</hi> 2. to 14, 15. and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there diſproved in any quotation, but remaineth full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to anſwer all he hath ſaid to fault it, beſides the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that which it now acknowledged a proofe for, are both ſhewn in that Treatiſe, and in the firſt part of my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Garner,</hi> to be plainly ſet forth, and proved in the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His way of faulting the diſtinction, is by framing reaſons and calling Scripture to make a conſequent with though I hope he will not juſtifie the Saduces ſo reaſoning from Scripture,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47546:77"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. as divers in our-dayes alſo have done, to deny the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection of the body) But this with all that followes in his leaſons is anſwered, and the abuſe of Scripture therein ſhewn before in that Treatiſe, in divers places, to which he hath ſaid nothing and again in the firſt and third part of the Reply to M. <hi>Garner,</hi> ſo as for anſwer, no more need, but only to deſire the Reader to peruſe the ſame; though the Reader of his may ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his firſt reaſon, much weakneſſe; for whatever recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation be wrough with God in Chriſt by his Death; yet no men are reconciled to God, but by the ſpirituall application thereof, when the love of God is there through commended to the heart, which ſlayes the enmity there, and reconciles to God, in receit of the atonement, whence the words, <hi>while wee were &amp;c.</hi> and being now juſtified, and wee have now received Atonement: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8 9.10, 11. The <hi>Colotians</hi> were enemies in their minds, by wicked workes in which they walked, after Chriſt had dyed, yea, and made peace, in preſenting the vertue of his death before God alſo, and by application of this were after reconciled to God: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22, 23. Beſides, he is not able to prove, that the Death of Chriſt is agreater worke then the reſurrection of Chriſt, nor that the reconciling to God, by love commended through the death, of Chriſt a greater worke, then the further ſaving by the power of the Spirit of life, by which he roſe from the dead; which ſounds harſh to <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17.19, 20. though his ſo ſaying acknowledgeth the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>As for his altering the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. it may be ſaid, God doth not give an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>glorified Sonne to his, but having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all; it is not ſaid, how ſhall he not deliver up all things for us, but as he ſaid, if he give him to us (who was delivered for us, and is wiſdome, righteouſneſſe &amp;c.) how (ſaith the text) ſhall he not with him (in giving him) freely give us all things, which makes nothing for Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His next reaſon is anſwered in the Treatiſe oppoſed, and in reply to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Its no where ſaid, that the world hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, nor that God will not impute ſin
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47546:77"/>to the world, though Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> take liberty to confound and limit generall propoſitions with ſpeciall applications, and to blot out difference between preſent, preterperfect, and future tenſe, here, and elſe where.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His third Reaſon, is dubious and forceleffe, and anſwered in the Treatiſe oppoſed, and in reply to Mr. <hi>Garner,</hi> about the word, <hi>Advocate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. His fourth Reaſon is grounded upon an overſight of the change of perſon, in the Apoſtles ſpeeches, from verſe 14 to 21 in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and miſ conception of the word, <hi>might,</hi> as is ſhewn in reply to Mr. <hi>Garner,</hi> about that word.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His fifth Reaſon hath an equivocation in the words, <hi>hath reconciled,</hi> which ſhould be, <hi>hath wrought reconciliation in his own body,</hi> or reconciled the nature of mankind in himſelfe for all mon, and then his conſequence is not true of all men, nor doth a <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3. ſpeake of any more then, the then Beleevers, yea, in thoſe words not of all them, as the next verſes, the change of perſons ſhew, and ſo prove not Mr. <hi>Garners</hi> ſayings at all.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For his ſixt reaſon, I forbeare to note what appeares in it, I deſire to deale reverently with him, and not to provoke him, for Chriſt by his death, reſurrection and Sacrifice, hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all men of God, and wrought reconciliation in their nature in himſelfe for them, and doth uſe meanes that it might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them, which if they perſit in rebellious reſuſing, and when he opens their eyes, will not ſee, their ſaying, if he give them up, and doe no more, he is but a halfe Saviour, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe themſelves, nor hurt him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His ſeventh reaſon is grounded on a ſlander, as is fore ſhown, and built up with queries, to which anſwer enough, is both in the Treatiſe, and in the reply to Mr. <hi>Garner,</hi> and all the world being Chriſts, out of which thoſe that are choſen in the heavenly call to him, are his peculiar, and have his Spirit: I marvell at his paſſages in this buſineſſe, as if ſome were his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, before they have his Spirit, and after ſhall have, or as if the greateſt number of men were their own (as evill men ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.) for if they be Gods, and not their own, then they are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47546:78"/>Chriſts alſo, and that by vertue of his ranſome: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.9</p>
            <p>That which he ſaith is the ſecond ground of <hi>T. M.</hi> proof is, A diſtinction between a common ſalvation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for all, and a ſpeciall ſalvation, which he hath purchaſed for Beleevers, this <hi>T.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. I doe not conceive ſo groſly, carnally, and ſcantily of Chriſt, as if he were not the Saviour, and author of ſalvation; but only a purchaſer of it, only a bargain maker with God, a purchaſer of ſome things for the Father to give to another, I beleeve him ſo to have purchaſed, as to have all into his diſpoſe ſo as he hath power to forgive, ſinnes, and to give eternall life and is able to ſave, and able to deſtroy; yea, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth nothing without him, but whatſoever the Father doth, the Son doth the ſame, and God would have all men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son as they honour the Father: <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>John</hi> 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſecond of his reported my grounds, being his own framed poſition, to anſwer, it is meet himſelfe deale with it, and not I, whom it concernes not; and what concerneth this buſineſſe of mine, is already fully and largly anſwered in the Treatiſe, which became him to have anſwered, and not to flye that, and frame proſitions and objections, as him beſt liketh, and as he conceives his reaſons might beſt anſwer, and yet there is ſtill farther anſwer to all he ſaith in this Reply to Mr. <hi>Garner,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47546:78"/>in the firſt part, on <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 5.9.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the common ſalvation mentioned, <hi>Jud.</hi> 3. though I but quoted the place after this ſaying, The faith of this common ſalvation, is as the oppening the doore to the ſpeciall Text, p. 11. And ſo gave no occaſion of his, if ſalvation be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a ſpeciall ſenſe, for I deſire not to take any part of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wrought by Chriſt in his own body, or extended by vertue thereof to men in a carnall ſenſe, but ſpiritually, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſalvation, becauſe it comes from the Lord the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, and hath evidence, and motives in it to ſpirituall good, even that part of it, which is in preſervation of the old creation, how much more that which exceeds, and hath its ends and tendancy towards eternall life, though it be not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life which is the ſpeciall, but what ſalvation is meant <hi>Jud.</hi> 3. whether the common, in beleefe whereof the ſpeciall is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or the ſpeciall only, I have the Reader for anſwer to conſider what is ſaid, <hi>Jud.</hi> 4, 5. of the types ſome deſtroyed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaved; and for the ſanctification &amp;c. mentioned, conſider <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19 for whom ſurely he prayed, and was as dilligent as for theſe, other Reply I make not, leaſt I ſhould occaſion his zeale to become fury.</p>
            <p>As for his affirming the ſalvation no larger then the faith, and becauſe the faith of the ſalvation is not given to all, therefore the ſalvation was no farther common then to them that had it: His undertaking to be a Miniſter of the Goſpell to many nigh <hi>Rutland, Lincolne ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Yermouth,</hi> who at that time had not that faith given them, doth confute his ſaying, though one might alſo ſay, there is more in the ſalvation wrought by Chriſt both common and ſpeciall, then any words in doctrine can fully ſet forth without divine Spirit to diſcover, or will be fully manifeſted, till no more need of ſuch mediums to ſee through, whence that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. and more then our faith can fully apprehend, and for more then at that time had, or yet have that faith, and for that he ſaith of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. It is ſtill life divinely ſpoken, and I am ſorry it hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his pen, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe words are not ſpoken of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon; of Chriſt as Mediator, but of God, by whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47546:79"/>all men are preſerved, eſpecially Beleevers, Oh that thoſe called. Anti-trinitarians, might not read this ſaying of Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> for they deny not Chriſt as Mediator to be a diſtinct perſon, but only that in this one Almighty living God, there ſhould be three diſtinct unſeparable, undevided, as I beleeve there are in this one God, though they ſay but one perſon, and that the Father, and what leſſe ſaith hee, that ſaith plainly, Theſe words are not ſpoken of the ſecond perſon, ſurely he meant not ſo, he beleeveth the ſecond perſon to be the ſame one living God that the Father is, nor is his after ſentence of Chriſt as Mediator any helpe, or leſſe free from error, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Sonne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. to 27. And the Father hath given him Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to execute judgement, alſo becauſe he is the Sonne of man, he it is by whom the Earth and the Inhabitants there of are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and by whom all things conſiſt; <hi>Pſalme</hi> 75.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17, 18 nor is there any preſervation of mankind fallen into ſinne, nor of creatures for his uſe, but through a Mediator, for God <hi>whoſe mercies are over all his workes, is holy and righteous in all his wayes, Pſalme</hi> 85.10. &amp; 145.8.17. So as all providence is by God in Chriſt, and all diſpenſation of mercies, and meanes through him; ſurely he might have learned a more divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the words <hi>[God who is the Saviour]</hi> from <hi>Paul</hi> (if he diſpiſed him not, becauſe ſometimes he was a Tent-maker) who opens, and gives the ſenſe of that, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 45.21, 22, 23. no God elſe beſids me, <hi>A juſt God, a Saviour, I am God and none elſe, unto me every knee ſhall bow,</hi> as meant of Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> faies here, the word ſignifies no more, but a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; I pray doth not that word reach far enough, ſurely ſuch as know the originall, as well as he ſay, its the ſame word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10 <hi>unto you is borne this day a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> gloſſe might reply, that can be no ſuch good tidings of great joy unto all people (that are fallen into ſinne) or that is no more but a preſerver, which God was from the beginning, and is of all men without Chriſt as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, theſe are dangerous gloſſes; yea, the ſame word ſay ſome is frequently uſed for Saviour, in the Apoſtles writings: The
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47546:79"/>reſt that followes, is fore-anſwered here pag. 4. But when the wiſdome of man will preſume to teach what muſt be wiſdome in Chriſt, wee are not like to judge a right of any thing; nor will his death or ranſome be found to be in vain, of ſuch as are by him judged, to be a ſecond death, which I have writ at large in the diſcourſe of the precious blood of Chriſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for his objection ſet down as mine; Chriſt death is not in vain for thoſe who are damned; for hereby they are freed from origin all ſinne; this is neither my opinion nor faith, nor any ſuch thing in my Booke; ſurely if I ſhould ſay, he was non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt, to give a faire anſwer in reproving what was there ſaid, and ſo deviſed this objection, that he might hint to ſuch as never read my Booke, as if I held it, and ſo might ſeeme to them to have confuted me, when he hath done nothing leſſe; though all his anſwers to it, if they were bent againſt Chriſt his dying for all men; they are as much againſt his dying for any as for all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for that he puts as my objection, quoting page 39. Chriſts death is not in vain, though all be not ſavad, for he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make them ſavable: and to open a door that they may be ſaved; in this alſo he wrongs me, both in word and ſenſe; could not ſuch a one as Mr. <hi>Whitfield,</hi> have anſwered my ſayings, without framing them into a mould fit for his own turne, the one halfe of his ſaying, none of mine, and the reſt altered, which alſo was not brought in to ſuch an end, as he that reads chapter 7. may ſee; and my words are in page 39. That Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo dyed for every man, that he hath redeemed all mankind &amp; ſatisfied Gods juſtice, &amp; is become the propitiation for the ſinnes of all men, and hath made them ſavable, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the door that they might be ſaved; and is ſo faithfull and able, and uſeth ſuch meanes, that whoſoever periſheth, it will be through their own fault, and to the ſame purpoſe more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before page 36. and before that after an explication of the buſineſſe, page 11. that as he hath in himſelfe ſo ſaved all men; ſo being aſſended, he doth by vertue of his death, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought in himſelfe, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſuch meanes, and in ſome ſeaſons ſo put forth ſpirit therein that he makes all ſavable, ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47546:80"/>as there is a poſſibleneſſe in, and through him, and poſſibility with him, for all men to come in to him, to beleeve on him, and in beleeving to be eternally ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. with far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication, for that an examiner of leſſe conſcience and skill, then Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> profeſſeth to have, might have ſeene to have reported righter, and underſtood better, then to ſay hee knoweth not well what can be underſtood by making ſaveable, unleſſe a purchaſing a poſſibility of ſalvation for all, and for all, ſurely a wiſe man would not uſe ſo many reaſons to fault hee knew not what; but the Treatiſe declared my meaning fully; How I underſtand That Jeſus Chriſt hath, and doth make men ſaveable; where (as in the other Treatiſe is ſhewne the double enmity mankind fell into by ſin.</p>
            <p>And ſo firſt, how mans fall neceſſitated him in the day of his ſinning, in Dying to Dye; becauſe of the truth and juſtice of God; ſo as without death, no remiſſion of ſin, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, no juſtification, for God cannot lye, or be untrue, or unjuſt, ſo as here was a barre removed by Jeſus Chriſt, who Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all, all dyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Though to the diſhonour of the Death of Chriſt Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſay, God was able to ſave men even before Chriſt was given to dye, by what way and meanes hee ſhould think beſt: Though I beleeve Chriſt was given to Dye, (though not ſent forth to act it) in the firſt moment of <hi>Adams</hi> fall. But;</p>
            <p>Secondly, the fall and ſin of man did ſo corrupt the nature and diſpoſition of man, that though the death bee ſuffered by Chriſt for him, he will not come in to God; if ſomething be not done to change his nature and will, and draw him God ward, and for this Jeſus Chriſt hath aſcended to heaven; and received ſpirit in the man to ſend forth even to the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them, which he alſo doth ſend forth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68 18. And ſo as in my Treatiſes may be ſeene: I underſtand Jeſus Chriſt makes men ſaveable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In himſelfe, as he is the ſecond man, the laſt <hi>Adam</hi> that ſtood in the place, and undertook for the firſt publique man; for him, and all that were in him, having taken the ſame nature, and in it dyed; fure for the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, or elſe for no mans
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47546:80"/>ſin, and if for his ſin, then for all mens ſin, or elſe his ſin was not al mens ſin, and he is in that nature riſen juſt, and hath offered up himſelfe a Sacrifice for man, and is now in mans nature glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, ſo that in him is peace, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. So as in him as the publique man, the nature of all mankind, is as fully, yea, more abundantly ſaved, reſtored and enriched with glorious ſalvation, then it was fallen in the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> and this is as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him for mankind, as the fall, and death of the former was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſalvation, and life in Jeſus the ſecond publique man, is as vertuous and more vertuous, and powerfull in him, and fuller of efficacie, to make all that by grace come in to him like himſelfe, then the ſin and death of the former, to make thoſe that by propagation come forth from him, like him: And both theſe are evident <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.14.18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 46 47. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. And this is great ſalvation, actuall ſalvation in Chriſt for men before it be preached, or hee ſet forth as the propitiation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2-4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He by vertue of this hee hath done, and is become with God for men, is now the Mediator between God and men, and ſo procureth of God for men, and extendeth towards them, the preſervation of the creatures for their uſe, and ſpace of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 9. which the Apoſtle cals <hi>Salvation,</hi> and wills us ſo to account it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. The Diſpenſation of meanes, and mercies as teſtimonies of his goodneſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. which the Apoſtle ſaith, is to <hi>lead to repentance, and ſeeking the Lord, Act.</hi> 17.26, 27.30 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. And with theſe means, at ſome ſeaſons, ſome ſtrift and motions of his Spirit to reprove &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.23.24. And this with ſo much efficacy, that at ſome or other enlightens every one in ſome meaſure that commeth into the world that was made by him, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.9.10. And by his workes manifeſteth ſome truth in men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19. and ſo ſtriveth with them. But all this more openly, and abundantly where he ſends the Goſpell which is a preaching of great ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 3. wherein alſo is ſome preſence of Chriſt by his Spirit to diſcover, witneſſe, reprove, draw to, and apply ſalvation: Though many breake all bands, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26, 27. &amp; 16.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47546:81"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.3, 4, 7. And this, that they might <hi>beleeve, Joh.</hi> 1 7 <hi>and be ſaved, Joh.</hi> 5.34. And this with ſo much prevailency that he bringeth them in ſome meaſure to ſee, and heare, and toucheth their hearts; Though divers like not the light, and, ſo willingly cloſe their eyes and eares, and harden their hearts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.27. And all this is actuall ſalvation, and extended that men might come in to him, and partake of eternall.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He hath eternall life, and ſalvation to beſtow on every one of them that in theſe his drawings come into him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9. And all this was in, and by Chriſt from the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his undertaking with God, as is fore-ſhewne; though ſince his comming in the fleſh, more manifeſt, and in the fruits more abundant: And this is meant by his making all men ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; ſo as thoſe empty, and undivine reaſons of; A purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing only a poſſibility of ſalvation; Of the ineffectualneſſe of Chriſt his death before his acting it; Of reſtraining the word <hi>Death,</hi> to the act of his dying; Of redeeming God, of making ſalvation actuall by faith (faith being neither Diſcoverer, nor Applyer; but only the receiver of what he by Spirit in the means diſcovers and applyes.) Of urging that, if a potentiall wrought (that ſhould be the phraſe) Then no actuall; as, If he the God of the Valleys, then not of the Mountaines, are of no force, and beſeemed Lay-preachers better then Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> As for the other objections of his owne framing, I may leave them to his owne Anſwering, though he might be bold: There was a doore before ſo opened, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10 (as there was a well before <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> ſaw it, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 21.19.) elſe not only ſome, but all, both Jewes and Gentiles, before Chriſt came in the fleſh, are periſhed for ever: But I may not ſlip over his Anſwer of his owne framed objection; That if Chriſt Dyed not for all, they want a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith; To which he replyeth, No. For the foundation of both our faith and obedience, is not the ſecret, but the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God which enjoynes every man to beleeve on him whom the Father hath ſent, &amp;c. Surely here he hath ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if he would either ſtand by it, or make any thing of it; But according to his direction wee muſt ſearch to that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47546:81"/>place, and here and there I will make the beſt of it that I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As God is one, ſo his will, and though there be much more ſecret then is yet revealed, yet hath he not in his word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed any one thing for men to believe as his mind, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his will that is yet ſecret; his ſayings are all true, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.6 9. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2.20, 21. what an intimation of a heavy charge is this to the ſayings of the God of truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Miniſter of the Goſpell, or a Beleever, ought to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle no farther about the will of God concerning any thing in their declaration, then what by word or workes he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. to which thoſe who are ſubmitted; when God ſaith, his Sonne dyed for all, will not conceit another ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret meaning, and uſe reaſons to ſcare men from beliefe of his teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The foundation of Repentance, faith, and new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not the injunction to beleeve &amp;c. But that which is to be beleeved; even Jeſus Chriſt as he is ſet forth in the Goſpell: <hi>Iſay.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. And for whom there is not the Chriſt that hath dyed for their ſinnes, and roſe for their juſtification, there is no foundation for repentance, or faith, nor is there any injunction for, or liberty to, or hope in it for any man to repent or beleeve, or to looke to Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if where Goſpell comes, they doe not firſt beleeve, that Chriſt dyed for their ſinnes, and roſe for their juſtification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1 4 17. ſo that in this grant, Mr. <hi>T.W.</hi> hath run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into ſuch ſnares, as he ſnares himſelfe worſe to get out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſaying every one is enjoyned to beleeve on Chriſt page 7. And yet that it may be denyed, that all men are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on Chriſt, page 68.</p>
            <p>Put a duty to beleeve inſtead of Chriſt, for the foundation of faith, page 7. Proclaiming ſuch commands as God gives for men to walke in, to be ſome of them contrary to the inward mind of God, &amp; ſome contrary one to another, ſurely if Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes may be granted, this denies them nothing, but how may this appeare; he ſaith, God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a command to kill his Sonne, and then another not to kill, which latter being his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47546:82"/>purpoſe, was croſſe to the former command page 49. &amp; 84. But where will he prove this, not in the revealed word of God, for that tels us, God bad <hi>Abraham</hi> offer his Sonne for a burnt offering, and ſo much was revealed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. And <hi>Abraham</hi> not knowing that this contained any leſſe then to offer him up a burnt offering, he did offer, and intended to ſlay (there was his tryall) but the latter command though croſſing <hi>Abrahams</hi> intentions, did enlighten his underſtanding, and ſo he ſaw not one command croſing another, but obeyed both, in offering his Sonne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. and not ſlaying him, but offering the Ram a burnt offering: And as for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he had hardened his own heart long before, nor was Gods hardening any other but the withſtanding that opperation, by which he had before been moving his heart, and ſo juſtly for his rebellion, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, leaving him to Satan, yet did he command nothing in charging him to let his people goe, but what he would have done; there being a people to be let goe, and he had done well if he had willingly yeelded it; but he brought him to it at laſt, as he will one day all thoſe that in the day of grace refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, bring them to it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. Oh what ſpirit is that which ſo ſets out the command of God, that he is faine to plead the equity of them, with that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. did the Apoſtle ſo in that place, or hath God done ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. ſurely his commands are righteous altogether, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. I ſet paſſe that might be ſaid in that which followes page 7. to avoid provocation: But as he deales with the command, ſo he is as croſſe to the Apoſtles, in ſetting forth the Goſpell to be beleeved, conſider page 169. Firſt, ſaith Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> no man is bound to beleeve Chriſt dyed for him, till he ſeele his need of him, and be humbled, but firſt to beleeve that God hath given his Sonne, to purchaſe redemption for all repenting ſinners, Now what Goſpell is this; what humiliation and repentance is that, and whence comes it, that muſt be before a man beleeve ſo much as that Chriſt dyed for him, Chriſt dyed for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his enemies, &amp;c. But ſuch as have repented, are not ſo called; yea, the Apoſtles have preached the death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt for men, to call and move them to repentance:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47546:82"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 13.37 39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſaith it is their duty to ſee, and feele their ſinnes, and be ſo humbled for them, as thereby they may be brought to repentance: See here, they muſt not ſee their ſinnes by this doctrine, as Chriſt was made finne, and a curſe for them, nor look upon them, as they have pirced him, and ſo come in to him, for they may not yet beleeve that he dyed for them; how croſſe is this to the Scripture, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and the Apoſtles preaching of repentance, who ſet it forth as the gift of Chriſt that is riſen from the dead, and exalted, and urged it one that ground that in beleeving it might be effected: <hi>Acts</hi> 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 13. &amp; 17.31.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hee ſaith that when they are truly humbled and brought to repentance, it is their duty to renounce their own righteouſneſſe, and reſt on Chriſt alone for ſalvation; ſtrange doctrin, that a man ſhould rely on Chriſt, before he can beleeve that Chriſt dyed for him; ſurely <hi>Paul</hi> was otherwiſe led; the knowledge of Chriſt produced his repentance, faith, confidence, and not theſe that <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he ſaith, that doing this, they ought to perſwade themſelves that Chriſt dyed for them, &amp;c. here is right, the cart to lead the horſe, and the building made the foundation; ſurely the Apoſtle receiving the atonement, throug divine love manifeſted in his death, did let goe his own righteouſneſſe, and depend on him to beſaved by his life <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.10, 11. Thus have I noted the Goſpell and ſaith Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> ſets forth: Oh you that through grace beleeve, is not this a humane faith, did ſuch a faith ever ſupport you in a day of tryall; and when God by Spirit in the word of grace teſtified of his Sonne, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his rich grace to your heart brought you in to believe, did not that melt, humble, and worke repentance in you, or were you left to view &amp; reaſon from ſuch things in you ſelves, to parſwade your own hearts to believe, I muſt a peale to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in this; and ſo to M. <hi>T. W.</hi> his own heart, becauſe of that 1 <hi>John</hi> 4, 5, 6. That which he ſaith is the third ground <hi>Tho.

Then I began to prove by opening the queſtion, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it in twelve anſwers by plain ſayings of Scripture, without interpretation or gloſſes, chapter 7. page 37.38, 39. which when Mr. <hi>T.

And this in anſwer to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> p. 8.9. whoſe croſſe and carnall expreſſions, I forbeare to put to tryall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I never ſaid nor writ, that every child can underſtand ſuch a figure as this; the Pot ſeethes over; where the ſubject is put for the adjunct; alas many Children may take the faſtened grumble on the outſide, as well as the pottage within, for an adjunct: But I ſaid, ſuch a ſaying may be underſtood by meane Country people (that know not what to call ſuch figures) yea, and profitably, ſo as the end of ſuch a voice, being to haſten the Mother to ſave the pottage from being loſt, which if ſhee ſtay to here a Clearke open the figure, and being delighted in hearing how figurative the childs ſpeech was, all may be loſt; I apply it not; But in the other figure, though a part be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put for the whole, that excludes not the whole, or elſe that he cals a part is the whole: But that God made all Nations, ſhould be a figure put for part; and that God made Iſraell ſhould be the proper ſpeech to limit, and explicate, I hope Mr. <hi>T.

Is there another Miniſter beſides M. <hi>W.</hi> or any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious among the people that will thus reaſon, when he can ſhew the place in holy Scripture, where it is ſaid of any part of the world or any ſort of men in the world, Chriſt did not dye for them, or that he dyed not for All, that he is not the Saviour of the world, not the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, then he may to ſome other ſayings put in his but, or only: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its ſhewn in the Treatiſe, as much reſtraint in ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory ſaying about Creation, Fall, Death, Reſurrection, Judgement, and that ſome for whom Chriſt dyed, periſh: And this for anſwer to page 14.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47546:85"/>namely, the Elect. But my Treatiſe ſaith otherwiſe; That by the world in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. is meant all the uncalled, whatſoever they are in Gods decree, of which they called are not; and for which world clearly diſtinct from all the called that believe Chriſt prayed for a bleſſing on the miniſtration of the called, that the uncalled (the world diſtinct) might beleeve, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.23. from which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> flyes when he comes at it, as fearing it would confute his confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: As for all that followes, it is ſo far from anſwering any thing that the Treatiſe remains ſtill anſwer enough: Beſides, I go by plain ſayings of Scripture, and not by Sillogiſmes in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objections; and his ſillogiſme is ſlenderly proved.</p>
            <p>All thoſe, and only thoſe who are elected, are likewiſe redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, called, juſtified, glorified; This his propoſition.</p>
            <p>Now I may make the Aſſumption, not in two divers termes, and ſo forceleſſe, as he did: But in one, <hi>viz.</hi> But Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> is not glorified; let himſelfe make the concluſion, and prove it.</p>
            <p>But his main ſtrength for confutation is in his Title, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wherein he ſides with, and humours the prophane and ſcoffing company in uſing the language many do, when they are powring in ſtrong drinke, and powring out oathes with Jeering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches. But what he means by lay-preachers, I am left to gueſſe: I know the Scriptures diſtinguiſh between Governours and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as I hope he will not call the Governours, our King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Magiſtrates Lay; or of the people, but Magiſtrates; ſo I hope he will acknowledge himſelfe a ſubject, one of the people; True, before Chriſt came in the fleſh, there was a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Prieſts and Levites, and the reſt of the people of Iſrael; but now ſince Chriſt hath carried our nature to the right hand of God, he is the high Prieſt; and all that unfainedly believe, are the ſpirituall Prieſts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5-9. and the diſtinction is between the Church that is Gods inheritance, and the world out of which they are called and choſen; And this Church is the pillar of truth; the light of the world, and hath its authority for preaching each according to the faith, and gifts given from Chriſt, and not from men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3 11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 7 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. Though liberty of doing this in publique places is from the Governours. And that in the Church it ſelfe is a Diſtinction between Officers called Biſhops, or Elders and Deacons; and the reſt of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: And he that uſurpe an Office without a Church call, let
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47546:85"/>him bear his reproof; True, when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> began to uſurp authority over Princes, Then hee, and his Miniſters were called ſpirituall, and the Clergie as if they were the Church; and the Magiſtrates and people together, as their inferiours, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lavty; But I find not that language in the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: And I hope becauſe of the Covenant; it is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> But only hee meanes men that are not in his order, and ſo called as himſelfe, and then he begins wrong, for without diſparagement to him, or them be it ſaid, the opinion he maintaines is that which ſuch teach; And the objections I anſwered, I had them all in writing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Gentleman, that very like ſometimes hath been a Black-ſmith, the calling the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions proves, and faulting them. I had firſt from an Officer, ſometime a Shoo-maker; and the oppoſition from ſome other Gentlemen of other callings; And I hope Mr. <hi>Garner</hi> will not be aſhamed to ſay, he was an Apothecary: nor I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded will be glory in having Mr. <hi>T.

As for his charging them with wandering, I have known ſome of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for calling, have ſo done from place to place, to get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which I thinke he approves not, but going where ones calling, and Gods providence leads, is not wandring, though it were from <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> to great <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and from thence thither againe: I wiſh he may requite none evill for good.</p>

            <p>Theſe are the opinions cryed out againſt, which I have nor ſet downe to gaine approbation from any unbeleever.
